'; building could produce unreliable results.
 This usually can be resolved by moving the target's Headers build phase before Compile Sources.

PhaseScriptExecution

 This usually can be resolved by moving 
 so that it runs before the build phase that depends on its outputs.
a shell script phase
 This usually means the target's module map is copied after compiling its sources.
ProcessInfoPlistFile
 This can usually be resolved by moving the app extension embedding build phase to the end of the list.
