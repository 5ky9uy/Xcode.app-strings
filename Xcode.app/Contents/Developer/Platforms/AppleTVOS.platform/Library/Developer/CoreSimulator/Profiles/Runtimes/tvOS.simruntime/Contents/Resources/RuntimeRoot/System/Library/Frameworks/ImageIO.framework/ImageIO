Identifies the number of matrix elements, if any, represented by this object.  The actual matrix coefficients are represented by the `Mmatrix_coeffs' attribute.  Matrices are used to describe reversible and irreversible inverse component decorrelation transforms.  This is done by referencing the current attribute's instance index from the second field in each record of the `Mstage_xforms' attribute used to describe a multi-component transformation stage.  Thus, for example, "Mstage_xforms:I1={MAT,1,4,0,0},{MAT,3,0,1,0}" declares that a given multi-component transform stage, having instance index 1, and two component collections, employs matrix transforms for both collections.  The first collection's matrix is described by `Mmatrix_size:I1' and `Mmatrix_coeffs:I1', while the second collection's matrix is described by `Mmatrix_size:I3' and `Mmatrix_coeffs:I3'.  To understand the last two fields in each record of the `Mstage_xforms' attribute, please refer to the separate description of that attribute.
Coefficients of the matrix, if there is one, whose number of elements is given by `Mmatrix_size'.  The coefficients appear in row-major order (first row, then second row, etc.).  The height and width of the matrix are not recorded here, but matrices are not required to be square.  For reversible transforms, the matrix coefficients are required to be integers.
Identifies the number of vector elements, if any, represented by this object.  The actual vector coefficients are represented by the `Mvector_coeffs' attribute.  Vectors are used to describe offsets to be applied to the component sample values after inverse transformation.  This is done by referencing the current attribute's instance index from the third field in each record of the `Mstage_xforms' attribute used to describe a multi-component transform stage.  Thus, for example, "Mstage_xforms:I1={MAT,1,4,0,0},{MAT,3,0,1,0}" declares that a given multi-component transform stage, having instance index 1, and two component collections, employs matrix transforms for both collections.  The first collection also involves offsets, described via `Mvector_size:I4' and `Mvector_coeffs:I4', while the second collection does not use offsets.  to understand the remaining fields in each record of the `Mstage_xforms' attribute, consult the separate description of that attribute.
Coefficients of the vector, if there is one, whose number of elements is given by `Mvector_size'.  Unlike `Mmatrix_coeffs' and `Mtriang_coeffs', this attribute is extrapolated if insufficient parameters are supplied -- that is, the last supplied value is replicated as required in order to provide all `Mvector_size' vector elements.
Identifies the total number of sub-triangular matrix elements, if any, represented by this object.  A sub-triangular matrix is square, with no coefficients above the diagonal and at least one coefficient missing from the diagonal.  A strictly sub-triangular M x M matrix will have M*(M-1)/2 coefficients, all below the diagonal.  Matrices of this form are used to describe irreversible multicomponent dependency transforms.  Reversible dependency transforms, however, include all but the upper left diagonal entry, for a total of M*(M+1)/2-1 coefficients.  Dependency transforms are described by referencing the current attribute's instance index from the second field in each record of the `Mstage_xforms' attribute used to describe a multi-component transform stage.  Thus, for example, "Mstage_xforms:I1={DEP,5,0,0,0}" declares that a given multi-component transform stage, having instance index 1, and one component collection, employs a dependency transform, whose coefficients are counted by `Mtriang_size:I5' and found in `Mtriang_coeffs:I5'.
Coefficients of the sub-triangular matrix, if any, whose number of elements is represented by the `Mtriang_size' attribute.  The coefficients are arranged in row-major order.  Thus, for a dependency transform with M inputs and outputs, the first coefficient (first two for reversible transforms) comes from the second row of the matrix, the next two (three for reversible transforms) comes from the third row of the matrix, and so forth.  For reversible transforms, the coefficients must all have integer values.

This attribute is used to describe a list of input component indices which are used by all transform blocks in a single stage of the multi-component transform.  This list of component indices is a concatenation of the index ranges <A1>-<B1>, <A2>-<B2>, ..., where An <= Bn are the first and second fields in the n'th record of the `Mstage_inputs' attribute.   The list of input component indices may contain repeated values, but must cover all components produced by the previous stage (or all codestream component indices, if this is the first stage).  In particular, it must always include 0.  The first transform block operates on the first N1 components identified by this list; the second transform block operates on the next N2 components in this list; and so forth.
This attribute is used to describe a list of output component indices which are produced by this stage.  This list  of component indices is a concatenation of the index ranges <A1>-<B1>, <A2>-<B2>, ..., where An <= Bn are the first and second fields in the n'th record of the `Mstage_outputs' attribute.  The list of output component indices may not contain any repeated component indices, but it may contain "holes".  The transform stage is considered to generate components with indices from 0 to the largest index in the output list; any components in this range which are not listed (these are the holes) are taken to be identically equal to 0.  The first transform block in the stage processes the first N1 components in the list to produces the first M1 components in the output list; the second transform block in the stage processes the next N1 components in the input list, producing the next M2 components in the output list; and so forth.
This attribute provides the values Nc and Mc which appear in the descriptions of `Mstage_inputs' and `Mstage_outputs', for each transform block (equivalently, each component collection), c.  The `Mstage_blocks' parameter attribute should contain one record for each transform.  Each record contains two strictly positive integers, identifying the number of input components Nk, and the number of output components, Mk, produced by the k'th transform.  No transform may consume or produce 0 components.  Between them, the various transform blocks must consume all components in the input list described by `Mstage_inputs' and produce all components in the output list described by `Mstage_outputs'.
This attribute provides one record for each transform block, which describes the type of transform to be implemented in that block and the parameters of the transform.  The first field identifies the transform as one of "dependency transform" (`DEP'), "decorrelation matrix transform" (`MAT'), or "discrete wavelet transform" (`DWT').
   The 2'nd field of each record holds the instance index of the `Mtriang_coeffs' (for dependency transforms) or `Mmatrix_coeffs' (for decorrelation matrix transforms) attributes, which provide the actual transform coefficients, unless the transform is a DWT; in this last case the 2'nd field holds 0 for the 9/7 DWT, 1 for the 5/3 DWT, or the instance index (in the range 2 to 255) of an `ATK' marker segment whose `Kreversible', `Ksymmetric', `Kextension', `Ksteps' and `Kcoeffs' attributes describe the DWT kernel.
   The 3'rd field of each record holds the instance index of the `Mvector_coeffs' attribute which describes any offsets to be applied after inverse transformation of the input components to the block.  A value of 0 for this field means that there is no offset; otherwise, the value must be in the range 1 to 255.
   For DWT transforms, the 4'th field in the record identifies the number of DWT levels to be used, in the range 0 to 32, while the final field holds the transform origin, which plays the same role as `Sorigin', but along the component axis.  For dependency and decorrelation transforms, the 4'th field must hold 0 if the transform is irreversible, or 1 if it is reversible, while the 5'th field must hold 0.

mcc != NULL
Unable to modify the existing multi-component transform to work with a reduced number of codestream image components during transcoding.  Cannot create a taylored null transform to interface the components, since all allowed MCC marker segment instance indices have been used up already.
Identifies the number of stages in the multi-component transform to be applied to this tile, or (for main header attributes) as a default for tiles which do not specify the `Mnum_stages' attribute.  If this value is 0, the spatially transformed codestream components associated with the relevant tile are mapped directly to the output components specified via the global `Mcomponents', `Msigned' and `Mprecision' attributes.  If `Mcomponents' is larger than `Scomponents', some final components are automatically set to 0.  Where the number of stages is 0, codestream components which are identified as unsigned by the `Ssigned' attribute are first offset (at least nominally) by half their dynamic range, in the usual fashion.  If, on the other hand, `Mnum_stages' specifies a non-zero number of transform stages, component offsets must be provided by the multi-component transform stages themselves.
   It is worth noting that the above description applies to inverse transformation (synthesis) during decompression.  For a discussion of the conditions under which an appropriate forward transform can be performed during compression, see the description of the `Mcomponents' attribute.
[This attribute defaults to 0 if a non-zero `Mcomponents' value exists, indicating the presence of a multi-component transform.]
Provides `Mnum_stages' records, each of which holds the instance index (in the range 0 to 255) associated with the `Mstage_inputs', `Mstage_outputs', `Mstage_blocks' and `Mstage_xforms' attributes which describe the corresponding stage in the inverse multi-component transform procedure.  The last stage is the one which produces the final decompressed components described by `Mcomponents', `Msigned' and `Mprecision'.
You cannot provide custom transform kernel data via `Ksteps' or `Kcoeffs' without also providing a value for the `Kreversible' attribute.

Malformed ATK marker segment encountered. The final 
Unable to write ATK marker segment yet! Some info missing.
Cannot transpose ATK marker segment information to a new codestream which has flippped geometry unless the transform filters are whole-sample symmetric, or flipping is to be applied in both the vertical and horizontal directions.  The reason for this is that the same transform kernels must be used in both directions, only one of which requires reversal of the lifting coefficients.
This attribute determines how the `Ksteps' and `Kcoeffs' attributes should be treated.  In the end, this parameter attribute must agree with the value of the `Creversible' attribute, for any tile-component which uses this transformation kernel.  However this consistency may be created by specifying `Kreversible' and leaving `Creversible' unspecified, so that an appropriate default value will be selected.
[A default value cannot be created automatically, so you must explicitly specify a value if you want ATK information to become available for any particular instance index in the main header or a tile header.]
If true, the transform kernel belongs to the whole-sample symmetric class, which is treated specially by JPEG2000 Part-2.  The translated impulse responses of these kernels are all symmetric about 0 -- see the Taubman & Marcellin book, Chapter 6, for a definition of translated impulse responses.  Equivalently, all lifting steps involve even-length symmetric lifting coefficients, Cs[n], where the coefficients associated with steps s=0, 2, 4, ... are symmetric about n = 1/2 and the coefficients associated with steps s=1, 3, 5, ... are symmetric about n = -1/2.
[If you do not explicitly specify this attribute, it will be determined automatically from the lifting coefficient values supplied via `Krev_coeffs' or `Kirv_coeffs', as appropriate.]
Identifies the boundary extension method to be applied in each lifting step.  If `CON', boundary samples are simply replicated.  The other possible value, `SYM', means that boundary samples are symmetrically extended.  The centre of symmetry in this case is the boundary sample location within an interleaved representation in which low-pass samples occupy the even indexed locations and high-pass samples occupy the odd indexed locations.  The `SYM' method must be used if `Ksymmetric' is true.  Conversely, for filters which do not have the whole-sample symmetric property, you are strongly recommended to use the `CON' extension method.
[Defaults to `SYM' if the filters are whole-sample symmetric and `CON' otherwise.]
(CON=0,SYM=1)
Array with one entry for each lifting step.  The first entry corrsponds to lifting step s=0, which updates odd indexed samples, based on even indexed samples; the second entry corresponds to lifting step s=1, which updates even indexed samples, based on odd indexed samples; and so forth.  The first field in each record holds the length, Ls, of the coefficient array Cs[n], for the relevant step s.  The second field is the location of the first entry, Ns, where Cs[n] is defined for n=Ns to Ns+Ls-1.  The value of Ns is typically negative, but need not be.  For symmetric kernels, Ls must be even and Ns must satisfy Ns=-floor((Ls+p-1)/2), where p is the lifting step parity (0 if s is even, 1 if s is odd).  The third and fourth fields must both be 0 if `Kreversible' is false.  For reversible transform kernels, however, the third field holds the downshift value, Ds, while the fourth field holds the rounding offset, Rs, to be added immediately prior to downshifting.
IIII
Holds the lifting coefficients, Cs[n].  The first L0 records describe the coefficients of the first lifting step.  These are followed by the L1 coefficients of the second lifting step, and so forth.  The Ls values are identified by the first field in each `Ksteps' record.  Lifting step s may be described by X_s[2k+1-p]=TRUNC(sum_{Ns<=n<Ns+Ls} Cs[n]*X_{s-1}[2k+p+2n]).  In the case of an irreversible transform, the TRUNC operator does nothing and all arithmetic is performed (at least notionally) in floating point.  For reversible transforms, TRUNC(a) = floor(a + Rs*2^{-Ds}) and Cs[n] is guaranteed to be an integer multiple of 2^{-Ds}.

Terminal splitting styles must have identical splitting instructions for all primary detail subbands (i.e., identical colon-separated sub-strings), in each of which all 2-bit splitting codes must be identical (i.e., sub-strings must consist of identical characters from the set, `-', `H', `V' and `B'.  The only exception to this rule is that where each primary subband is split only once, in which case it is sufficient for all primary subbands to be split once in the same direction (i.e., all `-', all `H--', all `V--' or all `B----').  These rules derive from the way in which Part-2 of the JPEG2000 standard extrapolates information found in ADS and DFS marker segments.

Illegal combination of `Clevels' and `Cads' values detected.  JPEG2000 Part-2 codestreams record the ADS table index associated with the `Cads' parameter in a tile-specific COD or COC marker segment in place of the `Clevels' value.  Thus, you cannot use a different `Clevels' value to the default inherited from a COD/COC marker segment with broader scope, while also specifying arbitrary decomposition styles via `Cads' and/or `Cdecomp'.
Illegal combination of `Clevels' and `Cdfs' values detected.  JPEG2000 Part-2 codestreams record the DFS table index associated with the `Cdfs' parameter in a main header COC marker segment in place of the `Clevels' value.  Thus, you cannot use a arbitrary downsampling factor styles while also providing a new value for `Clevels'.

Default progression order (may be overridden by Porder).  The four character identifiers have the following interpretation: L=layer; R=resolution; C=component; P=position. The first character in the identifier refers to the index which progresses most slowly, while the last refers to the index which progresses most quickly.
[Default is LRCP]

If "yes", the code-block partition is aligned so that the last sample in each nominal block (ignoring the effect of boundaries) is aligned at a multiple of the block dimension (a power of 2).  Equivalently, the first sample in each nominal block lies at a location which is a multiple of the block dimension, plus 1. By default (i.e., "no"), the first sample of each block is aligned at a multiple of the block dimension. The alignment is specified separately for both dimensions, with the vertical dimension specified first.
Number of wavelet decomposition levels, or stages.  May not exceed 32.

Index of the ADS marker segment used to hold Arbitrary Downsampling Style information.  If ADS information is involved, the value of the `Cads' index must lie in the range 1 to 127.  A value of 0 means that no ADS marker segment is referenced.  You will not normally set this parameter yourself.  It is preferable to allow the internal machinery to find a suitable index.  In any event, the ADS information recorded in the `DOads' and `DSads' attributes will be generated automatically from information contained in `Cdecomp'.  During marker segment reading, the ADS information is used together with any DFS information (see `Cdfs') in order to reconstruct the `Cdecomp' attribute.
[Best not to set this yourself.  An index is selected automatically if `Cdecomp' defines a non-trivial decomposition.]
Index of the DFS marker segment used to hold Downsampling Factor Style information.  If DFS information is involved, the value of the `Cdfs' index must be in the range 1 to 127.  A value of 0 means that no DFS marker segment is referenced.  This attribute is ignored outside of the main header (i.e., for non-negative tile indices).  You will not normally set this parameter yourself.  Rather, it is preferable to allow the internal machinery to find a suitable index for you.  In any event, the DFS instructions recorded in the `DSdfs' attribute will be generated automatically from information contained in `Cdecomp'.  During marker segment reading, the DFS instructions will be read, along with any ADS information (see `Cads') in order to reconstruct the `Cdecomp' attribute.
[Best not to set this yourself.  An index is selected automatically if `Cdecomp' defines a non-trivial decomposition.]
Manages the information associated with the JPEG2000 Part-2 `ADS' and `DFS' marker segments, if any, as referenced by the `Cads' and `Cdfs' attributes.  If neither of these is present, the default value of 3 is used, which yields the conventional Mallat decomposition structure.  Each record describes the subband splitting processes for one entire DWT level, starting from the first (highest frequency) level.  The textual form of each record commences with a primary splitting code, which is one of the characters: `B' (split both ways a la Mallat); `H' (split only horizontally); `V' (split only vertically); or `-' (do not split at all -- degenerate case).  The first option produces three primary detail subbands, denoted HL, LH and HH.  The second and third options produce only one primary detail subband (HX or XH), while the last option produces no detail subbands at all.  The primary splitting code is followed by parentheses, containing 0, 1 or 3 colon-separated sub-strings, each of which describes the additional splitting operations to be applied to each primary detail subband.  Each sub-string consists of 1, 3 or 5 characters, drawn from `-' (meaning no-split), `H' (meaning a horizontal split), `V' (meaning a vertical split) and `B' (meaning a bi-directional split).  If the sub-string commences with `H' or `V', two additional characters may be provided to describe further splitting of the low- and high-pass subbands produced by the first split.  If the sub-string commences with `B', four additional characters may be provided to describe further splitting of the LL, HL, LH and HH subbands produced by the primary split.  Alternatively, the sub-string may consist only of the initial character, in which case no further splitting is involved.  Thus, "B" and "B----" are equivalent sub-strings, as are "H" and "H--".
   If insufficient parameters are supplied to accommodate the number of desired DWT levels, the final value is simply replicated.  Note, however, that the last value must conform to some specific rules, which derive from the way in which JPEG2000 Part-2 defines extrapolation for information found in the ADS and DFS marker segments.  In particular, the terminal parameter must have identical splitting descriptors for all primary detail subbands (remember there are 0, 1 or 3 of these).  Moreover, within each of these descriptors, all splitting codes (`-', `H', 'V' and 'B') must be identical.  The only exception to this occurs where all primary detail subbands are split only once, in which case all primary detail subbands must have identical sub-strings holding one of the patterns, "B----", "H--", "V--" or "-".  Thus, "B(-:-:-)", "H(BBBBB)", "B(HHH:HHH:HHH)", "V(H--)" and "B(V--:V--:V--)" are all legal terminal values, while "B(B:B:-)" and "V(VV-)" are not legal.
[If `Cdecomp' is not specified, a value is determined from the ADS and/or DFS information referenced by `Cads' and `Cdfs'.  If there is no such information, the default `Cdecomp' value is "B(-,-,-)", which translates to the integer value, 3.  All Part-1 codestreams must use this Mallat decomposition style.]
Reversible compression?
[Default is irreversible, if `Ckernels' and `Catk' are not used.  Otherwise, the reversibility is derived from those values.]
Wavelet kernels to use.  The special value, `ATK' means that an ATK (Arbitrary Transform Kernel) marker segment is used to store the DWT kernel.  In this case, the `Catk' attribute must be non-zero.
[Default is W5X3 if `Creversible' is true, W9X7 if `Creversible' is false, and ATK if `Catk' is non-zero.]
(W9X7=0,W5X3=1,ATK=-1)
A value of 0 means that the DWT kernel is one of W5X3 or W9X7, as specified by the `Ckernels' attribute.  Otherwise, this attribute holds the index of the ATK marker segment which defines the transform kernel.  The index must lie in the range 2 to 255 and corresponding `Kreversible', `Krev_steps' or `Kirv_steps' attributes must exist, which have the same index (instance) value.  Thus, for example, if `Catk=3', you must also supply a value for `Kreversible:I3' and/or `Krev_steps:I3' or `Kirv_steps:I3', as appropriate.  This information allows the internal machinery to deduce whether the transform is reversible or not.  The ATK information in these parameter attributes can also be tile-specific.
[Default is 0]
Explicitly specify whether or not precinct dimensions are supplied.
[Default is "no" unless `Cprecincts' is used]
Precinct dimensions (must be powers of 2). Multiple records may be supplied, in which case the first record refers to the highest resolution level and subsequent records to lower resolution levels. The last specified record is used for any remaining lower resolution levels.Inside each record, vertical coordinates appear first.
Nominal code-block dimensions (must be powers of 2, no less than 4 and no greater than 1024). Actual dimensions are subject to precinct, tile and image dimensions. Vertical coordinates appear first.
[Default block dimensions are {64,64}]
Block coder mode switches. Any combination is legal.
[By default, all mode switches are turned off]

Multiplier for subband weighting factors (see `Clev_weights' and `Cband_weights' below).  Scaling all the weights by a single quantity has no impact on their relative significance.  However, you may supply a separate weight for each component, or even each tile-component, allowing you to control the relative signicance of image components or tile-components in a simple manner.
Weighting factors for each successive resolution level, starting from the highest resolution and working down to the lowest (but not including the LL band!!). The last supplied weight is repeated as necessary.  Weight values are squared to obtain energy weights for weighted MSE calculations.  The LL subband always has a weight of 1.0, regardless of the number of resolution levels.  However, the weights associated with all subbands, including the LL band, are multiplied by the value supplied by `Cweight', which may be specialized to individual components or tile-components.
Weighting factors for each successive subband, starting from the highest frequency subbands and working down (i.e., HH1, LH1, HL1, HH2, ...). The last supplied weight is repeated as necessary for all remaining subbands (except the LL band). If `Clev_weights' is also supplied, both sets of weighting factors are combined (multiplied).  Weight values are squared to obtain energy weights for weighted MSE calculations.  The LL subband always has a weight of 1.0, which avoids problems which may occur when image components or tiles have different numbers of resolution levels.  To modify the relative weighting of components or tile-components, including their LL subbands, use the `Cweight' option; its weighting factors are multiplied by those specified using `Cband_weights' and `Clev_weights'.  If the `Cdecomp' attribute is used to describe more general packet wavelet transforms, all subbands obtained by splitting an HL, LH or HH subband will be assigned the same weight.  No mechanism is provided for specifying their weights separately.  Moreover, all three weights (HL, LH and HH) are present for each resolution level, even if that level only involves horizontal or vertical splitting, and even in the degenerate case of no splitting at all.  For horizontal splitting only, subbands derived from HX use the corresponding HL weight; HH and LH weights are then ignored.  Similarly for vertical splitting only, subbands derived from XH use the corresponding LH weight; HH and HL weights are then ignored.

This attribute is ultimately set so as to hold the same information as the `Cdecomp' attribute of the COD/COC marker segment whose `Cads' holds our instance index.  Thus, for example, if `Cads'=3 then `Cdecomp' must be identical to `Ddecomp:I3'.  This identification is created by the internal machinery, however.  You should not explicitly set `Ddecomp' values yourself.
Number of sub-levels in each successive DWT level, starting from the highest level.  Accesses to non-existent values are supported by repeating the last available value.  All entries must lie in the range 1 to 3.  For the meaning of sub-levels in JPEG2000 Part-2, the reader is referred to Annex F of IS 15444-2.
[You would not normally set values for this parameter attribute yourself.]
Array of splitting instructions, whose interpretation generally depends upon the way in which ADS and DFS tables are jointly referenced from COD/COC marker segments, as identified by the `Cads' and `Cdfs' attributes.  Each splitting instruction must take one of the values: 3 (split horizontally and vertically); 2 (split vertically); 1 (split horizontally); or 0 (do not split).  The last value is repeated as necessary, if accesses are made beyond the end of the array.  For the meaning of these splitting instructions, the reader is referred to Annex F of IS 15444-2.

Malformed DFS marker segment encountered. The final 
Describes the primary subband decomposition type associated with each DWT level, starting from the highest resolution (1'st level).  The value may be one of `B' (split in both directions), `H' (split horizontally), `V' (split vertically) or `X' (don't split at all).  The last case is degenerate, since it means that the DWT level in question produces no detail subbands whatsoever, simply passing its input image through to the next DWT level.  However, this can be useful in some circumstances.  The primary subband decomposition determines the downsampling factors between each successive resolution level.  If there are more DWT levels than `DSdfs' values, the last available value is replicated, as required.

Quantization steps derived from LL band parameters? If "yes", all quantization step sizes will be related to the LL subband's step sizes through appropriate powers of 2 and only the LL band step size will be written in code-stream markers. Otherwise, a separate step size will be recorded for every subband. You cannot use this option with reversible compression.
[Default is not derived]
Base step size to be used in deriving irreversible quantization step sizes for every subband. The base step parameter should be in the range 0 to 2.
[Default is 1/256]
Absolute quantization step sizes for each subband, expressed as a fraction of the nominal dynamic range for that subband. The nominal range is equal to 2^B (B is the image sample bit-depth) multiplied by the DC gain of each low-pass subband analysis filter and the AC gain of each high-pass subband analysis filter, involved in the construction of the relevant subband. The bands are described one by one, in the following sequence: LL_D, HL_D, LH_D, ..., HL_1, LH_1, HH_1.  Here, D denotes the number of DWT levels.  Also, note that the actual set of subbands for which values are provided depends upon the decomposition structure identified via `Cdecomp'.  A single step size must be supplied for every subband (there is no extrapolation), except in the event that `Qderived' is set to "yes" -- then, only one parameter is allowed, corresponding to the LL_D subband.
[For compressors, the absolute step sizes are ignored if `Qstep' has been used.]
Number of range bits used to code each subband during reversible compression.  Subbands appear in the sequence, LL_D, HL_D, LH_D, ..., HL_1, LH_1, HH_1, where D denotes the number of DWT levels.  Note that the actual set of subbands for which values are provided depends upon the decomposition structure, identified via `Cdecomp'.  The number of range bits for a reversibly compressed subband, plus the number of guard bits (see `Qguard'), is equal to 1 plus the number of magnitude bit-planes which are used for coding its samples.
[For compressors, most users will accept the default policy, which sets the number of range bits to the smallest value which is guaranteed to avoid overflow or underflow in the bit-plane representation, assuming that the RCT (colour transform) is used.  If explicit values are supplied, they must be given for each and every subband.]

Illegal ROI up-shift, 
. Legal range is from 0 to 255!
Region of interest up-shift value.  All subband samples which are involved in the synthesis of any image sample which belongs to the foreground region of an ROI mask will be effectively shifted up (scaled by two the power of this shift value) prior to quantization.  The region geometry is specified independently and is not explicitly signalled through the code-stream; instead, this shift must be sufficiently large to enable the decoder to separate the foreground and background on the basis of the shifted sample amplitudes alone.  You will receive an appropriate error message if the shift value is too small.
[Default is 0]
Number of initial (highest frequency) DWT levels through which to propagate geometric information concerning the foreground region for ROI processing.  Additional levels (i.e., lower frequency subbands) will be treated as belonging entirely to the foreground region.
[Default is 4]
Region of interest significance weight.  Although this attribute may be used together with `Rshift', it is common to use only one or the other.  All code-blocks whose samples contribute in any way to the reconstruction of the foreground region of an ROI mask will have their distortion metrics scaled by the square of the supplied weighting factor, for the purpose of rate allocation.  This renders such blocks more important and assigns to them relatively more bits, in a manner which is closely related to the effect of the `Clevel_weights' and `Cband_weights' attributes on the importance of whole subbands.  Note that this region weighting strategy is most effective when working with large images and relatively small code-blocks (or precincts).

Progression order change information.  The attribute may be applied globally (main header), or in a tile-specific manner (tile-part header).  In this latter case, multiple instances of the attribute may be supplied for any given tile, which will force the generation of multiple tile-parts for the tile (one for each instance of the `Porder' attribute).  As with all attributes, tile specific forms are specified by appending a suffix of the form ":T<tnum>" to the attribute name, where <tnum> stands for the tile number, starting from 0.  Each instance of the attribute may contain one or more progression records, each of which defines the order for a collection of packets. Each record contains 6 fields. The first two fields identify inclusive lower bounds for the resolution level and image component indices, respectively. The next three fields identify exclusive upper bounds for the quality layer, resolution level and image component indices, respectively. All indices are zero-based, with resolution level 0 corresponding to the LL_D subband. The final field in each record identifies the progression order to be applied within the indicated bounds. This order is applied only to those packets which have not already been sequenced by previous records or instances.

(source_siz != NULL) && (target_siz != NULL)
(fact_x > 0) && (fact_y > 0)
Provides additional component registration offsets. The offsets add to those implied by the canvas coordinate system and should only be used when canvas coordinates (notably `Ssize', `Soffset' and `Ssampling') cannot be found, which adequately reflect the relative displacement of the components. Each record specifies offsets for one component, with the vertical offset appearing first. Offsets must be in the range 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive) and represent a fraction of the relevant component sub-sampling factor (see `Ssampling'). The last supplied record is repeated as needed to recover offsets for all components. 
Controls the division of each tile's packets into tile-parts.  The attribute consists of one or more of the flags, `R', `L' and `C', separated by the vertical bar character, `|'.  If the `R' flag is supplied, tile-parts will be introduced as necessary to ensure that each tile-part consists of packets from only one resolution level.  If `L' is supplied, tile-parts are introduced as necessary to ensure that each tile-part consists of packets from only one quality layer.  Similarly, if the `C' flag is supplied, each tile-part will consist of packets from only one component.  Note that the cost of extra tile-part headers will not be taken into account during rate control, so that the code-stream may end up being a little larger than you expect.
[By default, tile-part boundaries are introduced only as required by the presence of multiple "Porder" attribute specifications.]
[R=1|L=2|C=4]
Requests the insertion of packet length information in the header of all tile-parts associated with tiles for which this attribute is turned on (has a value of "yes").  The PLT marker segments written into the relevant tile-part headers will hold the lengths of those packets which belong to the same tile-part.  Note that the cost of any PLT marker segments generated as a result of this attribute being enabled will not be taken into account during rate allocation.  This means that the resulting code-streams will generally be a little larger than one might expect; however, this is probably a reasonable policy, since the PLT marker segments may be removed without losing any information.
Requests the insertion of TLM (tile-part-length) marker segments in the main header, to facilitate random access to the code-stream.  This attribute takes a single integer-valued parameter, which identifies the maximum number of tile-parts which will be written to the code-stream for each tile.  The reason for including this parameter is that space for the TLM information must be reserved ahead of time; once the entire code-stream has been written the generation machinery goes back and overwrites this reserved space with actual TLM data.  If the actual number of tile-parts which are generate is less than the value supplied here, empty tile-parts will be inserted into the code-stream so as to use up all of the reserved TLM space.  For this reason, you should try to estimate the maximum number of tile-parts you will need as accurately as possible, noting that the actual value may be hard to determine ahead of time if incremental flushing features are to be employed.  In any event, no JPEG2000 code-stream may have more than 255 tile-parts.  An error will be generated at run-time if the declared maximum number of tile-parts turns out to be insufficient.  You should note that this attribute may be ignored if the target device does not support repositioning functionality.

Restricted profile to which the code-stream conforms.  The value must be an integer in the range 0 to 5, corresponding to the identifiers `PROFILE0', `PROFILE1', `PROFILE2', `PART2', `CINEMA2K' and `CINEMA4K'.  PROFILE0 is the most restrictive profile for Part 1 conforming codestreams.  PROFILE2 places no restrictions on the code-stream other than those restrictions defined in ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG2000, Part 1).  A value of 3 (`PART2') means that the codestream requires support for one or more features defined in ISO/IEC 15444-2 (JPEG2000, Part 2).  If the system determines that support for Part 2 features is  required, the profile will be set automatically to 3.  Otherwise, the profile is not adjusted by Kakadu's codestream creation machinery.  However, if the profile is found to be insufficient, the system will generate a warning at the point where it first encounters an inconsistency; this might not occur until near the end of the processing in certain rare circumstances.  The `CINEMA2K' (4) and `CINEMA4K' (5) profiles were added later via an ammendment to Part 1.  They are in fact highly restrictive subsets of the Part 1 standard, taylored for the needs of digital cinema projection equipment.  These profiles are not currently checked for conformance, although that may well change in a future release.  If you don't know what you are doing, therefore, you should not label a codestream which you compress yourself as having either of these profiles.
[Defaults to Profile-2.]
(PROFILE0=0,PROFILE1=1,PROFILE2=2,PART2=3,CINEMA2K=4,CINEMA4K=5)
Flag indicating whether or not capabilities from additional parts (beyond parts 1 and 2) in the JPEG2000 family of standards are defined in a separate capabilities marker segment.
[Defaults to false.]
Logical OR of any combination of a number of flags, indicating extended features from Part 2 of the JPEG2000 standard which may be found in this codestream.  Note that the Kakadu codestream generation machinery will set these flags automatically based on features which are detected in other parameter objects.  Explanation: DC means arbitrary DC offset; VARQ means variable quantization; TCQ means trellis-coded quantization; PRECQ means precinct-dependent quantization; VIS means visual masking; SSO means single-sample-overlap transform; DECOMP means arbitrary decomposition styles; ANY_KNL means arbitrary transform kernels; SYM_KNL means arbitrary whole sample symmetric transform kernels; MCT means multi-component transform; CURVE means arbitrary point-transformation; and ROI means extended region-of-interest signalling.
[Defaults to 0.]
[DC=1|VARQ=2|TCQ=4|PRECQ=2048|VIS=8|SSO=16|DECOMP=32|ANY_KNL=64|SYM_KNL=128|MCT=256|CURVE=512|ROI=1024]
Canvas dimensions: vertical dimension first.
[For compressors, this will normally be derived from the dimensions of the individual image components. Explicitly supplying the canvas dimensions may be desirable if the source image files do not indicate their dimensions, or if custom sub-sampling factors are desired.]
Image origin on canvas: vertical coordinate first.
[Defaults to {0,0}, or the tile origin if one is given]
Tile partition size: vertical dimension first.
[Defaults to {0,0}]
Tile origin on the canvas: vertical coordinate first.
[Defaults to {0,0}]
Number of codestream image components.
[For compressors, this will normally be deduced from the number and type of image files supplied to the compressor.  Note carefully, however, that if a multi-component transform is used, the number of codestream image components might not be equal to the number of `output image components' given by `Mcomponents'.  In this case, the value of `Mcomponents' and the corresponding `Mprecision' and `Msigned' attributes should generally be associated with the image files being read (for compression) or written (for decompression).]
Indicates whether each codestream image component contains signed or unsigned sample values.
[For compressors, this will normally be deduced from the image files supplied to the compressor, but may be explicitly set if raw input files are to be used.  Also, if you happen to be using the Part-2 multi-component transform capabilities, the signed/unsigned attributes of the original image components should be expressed by `Msigned'; in this case, you will need to explicitly set `Ssigned' in a manner which reflects the signed/unsigned characteristics of the codestream image components produced after subjecting the original components to the forward multi-component transform.  Note that the last supplied identifier is repeated indefinitely for all remaining components.]
Indicates the bit-depth of each codestream image component.
[For compressors, this will normally be deduced from the image files supplied to the compressor, but may need to be explicitly set if raw input files are to be used.  Also, if you happen to be using the Part-2 multi-component transform capabilities, the precision of the original image components should be expressed by `Mprecision'; in this case, you will need to explicitly set `Sprecision' to reflect the bit-depth of the codestream image components produced after subjecting the original components to the forward multi-component transform.  Note that the last supplied value is repeated indefinitely for all remaining components.]
Indicates the sub-sampling factors for each codestream image component. In each record, the vertical factor appears first, followed by the horizontal sub-sampling factor. The last supplied record is repeated indefinitely for all remaining components.
[For compressors, a suitable set of sub-sampling factors will normally be deduced from the individual image component dimensions.]
Indicates the dimensions (vertical, then horizontal) of each individual image component. The last supplied record is repeated indefinitely for all remaining components.
[For compressors, the image component dimensions will normally be deduced from the image files supplied to the compressor, but may be explicitly set if raw input files are to be used.]
Number of image components produced at the output of the inverse multi-component transform -- during compression, you may think of these as original image comonents.  In any event, we refer to them as "MCT output components", taking the perspective of the decompressor.  The value of `Mcomponents' may be smaller than or larger than the `Scomponents' value, which refers to the number of "codestream image components".  The codestream image components are supplied to the input of the inverse multi-component transform.  Note carefully, however, that for Kakadu to perform a forward multi-component transform on image data supplied to a compressor, the value of `Mcomponents' must be at least as large as `Scomponents' and the inverse multi-component transform must provide sufficient invertible transform blocks to derive the codestream components from the output image components.  In the special case where `Mcomponents' is 0, or not specified, there is no multi-component transform.  In this case, `Scomponents', `Ssigned' and `Sprecision' define the output image components.
[Defaults to 0.  You must explicitly set a non-zero value for this attribute if you want to use Part-2 multi-component transforms.  Compressors might be able to deduce this information from the input files, if they are aware that you want to perform a multi-component transform.]
Indicates whether each MCT output component (see `Mcomponents' for a definition of "MCT output components") contains signed or unsigned sample values.  If fewer than `Mcomponents' values are provided, the last supplied identifier is repeated indefinitely for all remaining components.
[Compressors might be able to deduce this information from the image files supplied.]
Indicates the bit-depth of each MCT output component (see `Mcomponents' for a definition of "MCT output components").  If fewer than `Mcomponents' values are provided, the last supplied identifier is repeated indefinitely for all remaining components.

JPX data source appears to contain an incomplete codestream.  Specifically, this either means that an embedded contiguous or fragmented codestream has been found without sufficient descriptive metadata, or that a codestream header box has been found without any matching embedded contiguous or fragmented codestream.  Both of these conditions are illegal for JPX and JP2 data sources.

Insufficient implementation precision available for true reversible compression!
upshift >= 0
You have selected too small a value for the ROI up-shift parameter.  The up-shift should be at least as large as the largest number of magnitude bit-planes in any subband; otherwise, the foreground and background regions might not be properly distinguished by the decompressor.
downshift >= K_max
The ROI shift (`Rshift' attribute) which you are using is too large to ensure truly lossless recovery of both the foreground and the background regions, at least by Kakadu -- other compliant implementations may give up much earlier.  You might like to consider using the `Rweight' attribute instead of `Rshift' -- a 32x32 code-block size (not the default) is recommended in this case and `Rweight' should be set to around 2 to the power of the `Rshift' value you would have used.

Illegal marker code is 
tile->packed_headers->failed()
Packet header contains a representation which is not strictly illegal, but unreasonably large so that it exceeds the dynamic range available for our internal representation!  The problem is most likely due to a corrupt or incorrectly constructed code-stream.  Try re-opening the image with the resilient mode enabled.
Illegal inclusion tag tree encountered while decoding a packet header.  This problem can arise if empty packets are used (i.e., packets whose first header bit is 0) and the value coded by the inclusion tag tree in a subsequent packet is not exactly equal to the index of the quality layer in which each code-block makes its first contribution.  Such an error may arise from a mis-interpretation of the standard.  The problem may also occur as a result of a corrupted code-stream.  Try re-opening the image with the resilient mode enabled.
Illegal number of missing MSB's signalled in corrupted tag tree.  The value may not exceed 74 in any practical code-stream or any legal code-stream which is consistent with profile 0 or profile 1.  Try re-opening the image with the resilient mode enabled.

Encountered a corrupted packet while using packet length information to access the compressed data source in a random access fashion.

Profile violation detected (code-stream is technically illegal).  In a Profile-0 code-stream, all first tile-parts of all tiles must appear first, in exactly the same order as their respective tile numbers.
layer_idx < num_layers
Attempting to generate tile-part data without first determining packet lengths.  This may be a consequence of incomplete simulation of the packet construction process.
Cannot satisfy the request to generate PLT marker segments!  There are so many packets in one tile-part that it is beyond the capacity of the maximum 256 marker segments to represent length information for all tile-parts!!
Length of current tile-part exceeds the maximum value which can be represented by the 32-bit length field in the SOT marker!  You will have to split the code-stream into smaller tile-parts -- see the "ORGtparts" parameter attribute.

The `kdu_channel_mapping' object supplied to `kdu_region_decompressor::start' does not define any channels at all.
The `kdu_channel_mapping' object supplied to `kdu_region_decompressor::start' specifies more colour channels than the total number of channels.
Invalid expansion ratio supplied to `kdu_region_decompressor::start'.  The numerator and denominator terms expressed by the `expand_numerator' and `expand_denominator' arguments must be strictly positive.
Invalid expansion factors supplied to `kdu_region_decompressor::start'.  The ratio between `expand_numerator' and `expand_denominator' must be no less than 1.
Unable to represent all component expansion factors as rational numbers whose numerator and denominator can both be expressed as 32-bit signed integers.  This is a very unusual condition.
Invalid expansion factors supplied to `kdu_region_decompressor::start'.  The `expand_numerator' and `expand_denominator' coefficients must be chosen for the reference image component, such that all image components involved in the rendering process are guaranteed to have an expansion factor which is no less than 1.
The `region' passed into `kdu_region_decompressor::start' does not lie fully within the region occupied by the full image on the rendering canvas.  The error is probably connected with a misunderstanding of the way in which codestream dimensions are mapped to rendering coordinates through the rational upsampling process offered by the `kdu_region_decompressor' object.  It is best to use `kdu_region_decompressor::get_rendered_image_dims' to find the full image dimensions on the rendering canvas.

Channel buffers supplied to `kdr_region_decompressor::process' are too small to accommodate even a single line of the new region to be decompressed.  You should be careful to ensure that the buffers are at least as large as the width indicated by the `incomplete_region' argument passed to the `process' function.  Also, be sure to identify the buffer sizes correctly through the `max_region_pixels' argument supplied to that function.

Encountered underdetermined system while trying to invert a multi-component transform block so as to convert MCT output components into codestream components during compression.
Near singular irreversible decorrelation transform block encountered in multi-component transform description.  This can prevent the compression process from proceeding if there are no other paths back from the MCT output components to the codestream components.
Encountered an irreversible decorrelation transform block which operates on reversible codestream sample data.  While we allow such transforms to be processed during decompression, it is unreasonable to generate reversibly compressed component samples using an irreversible inverse multi-component transform during compression.  Kakadu will not invert this transform during compression.

line->need_irreversible
Inconsistent bit-depths encountered amongst output image components produced by a DWT transform block embedded inside the multi-component transform network.  All output (i.e., synthesized) components produced by a single DWT block must be declared with the same bit-depth.  Anything else makes no sense, so Kakadu does not bother trying to accommodate this case.

have_xform_size
Cannot implement multi-component transform.  It seems that image components which must be processed by a common transform block (or decorrelating colour transform) have incompatible dimensions.  This error may also be detected if the sub-sampling factors associated with an MCT output image component vary from tile to tile or if relative component size change from resolution level to resolution level (due to incompatible Part-2 downsampling factor style usage).  While these latter conditions might not be strictly illegal, they are clearly foolish.
Part-2 codestream declares a codestream component to have a different bit-depth (Sprecision) to the output component (Mprecision) with which it is directly associated.  While this is allowed, it makes very little sense, and Kakadu will not perform the required multiple scaling for irreversibly transformed components.
create_resources
codestream_collection->components[n] == &(comp->line)
Cannot implement multi-component transform.  It seems that one or more transform steps require image samples to be treated as reversible, where other steps require the same image samples to be treated as irreversible.  This is illegal in Part-1 of the JPEG2000 standard.  Although Part-2 is not clear on the matter, Kakadu's implementation insists only that irreversibly compressed samples not be subjected to reversible multi-component transform processing during decompression -- this is eminently reasonable, since exact reversible processing of data which is not already exactly defined, makes no sense.  The reverse case, in which reversibly compressed data is processed using an irreversible multi-component transform, can make sense, particularly where there are multiple ways to render the same original reversibly compressed codestream components to MCT outputs.
line->is_constant
comp->num_rows_in_progress <= comp->line.size.y
comp->num_available_rows <= comp->line.size.y
prepare_network_for_inversion
n < block->num_components
Cannot perform forward multi-component transform based on the source image components supplied.  The multi-component transform is defined from the perspective of decompression (i.e., synthesis, or inverse transformation).  Not all of the defined transform blocks may be invertible.  Also, if the defined transform blocks do not use all codestream components to produce final output image components during decompression, it will not be possible to work back from the final image components to codestream components which can be subjected to spatial wavelet transformation and coding.  One of these conditions has been encountered with the configuration you are targeting during compression.

Illegal Stlm field encountered in TLM marker segment!
Malformed TLM marker segment encountered in main header.  Segment length is inconsistent with the number of bytes used to represent pointer info for each tile-part.
Illegal TLM marker segment data encountered in main header.  An illegal tile number has been identified, either explicitly or implicitly (through the rule that missing tile identifiers are legal only when tiles appear in order with only one tile-part each).
TLM marker segments contain one or more illegal lengths (< 14 bytes).  Proceeding with incomplete tile-part length information.
PLT marker segments appear out of order within one or more tile-part headers.  While this is not illegal, it is highly inadvisable since it prevents immediate condensation of the pointer information by efficient parsers.  To process this code-stream, you will have to open it again, with file seeking disabled.
There appears to be a problem with the PLT marker segments included in the input code-stream.  The PLT marker segments encountered so far do not have sufficient length information to describe the lengths of all packets in the tile-parts encountered so far.  To process this code-stream, you will have to open it again, with file seeking disabled.

Unexpected change in coding parameters or packet sequencing detected after parsing packet length information in PLT marker segments.  While this is not illegal, it is highly inadvisable.  To process this code-stream, open it again with file seeking disabled!
Unexpectedly ran out of packet length information while processing tile-parts.  Most likely cause is that PLT marker segments are malformed, incomplete, or do not appear until after the packets whose lengths they describe.  All of these conditions are violations of the standard!
kd_precinct_pointer_server runs into file corruption
Tile-part holds some but not all the packets of a precinct for which PLT information is being used to extract precinct addresses for random access.  In particular, the current tile has its packets sequenced so that all packets of any given precinct appear consecutively and yet a tile-part boundary has been inserted between the packets of a precinct.  While this is not illegal, it indicates very poor judgement in the placement of tile-part boundaries.  To process this code-stream, you will have to open it again with file seeking disabled.
The compressed data buffer server is being destroyed before all allocated buffers have been returned.  The problem is most likely connected with a bug in the code-block destruction code.
The compressed data buffer server is being destroyed before all size accounting associated with fixed data structures has been completed.  This is most likely due to a bug in the memory accounting logic used for dynamic cache management.

 (starting from 0) in the multi-component transform for some tile (or in the main header).  Either the `Mstages' attribute contains insufficient entries, or no `Mstage_blocks' attribute exists with the instance identifier provided by `Mstages'.
Multi-component transform blocks must each have a strictly positive number of inputs and outputs, as identified by the `Mstage_blocks' parameter attribute.

Unable to access the offset parameters identified by an `Mstage_xforms' parameter attribute.  Specifically, there should be an `Mvector_size' attribute, with instance index 
 and value 
, corresponding to the number of output components produced by the multi-component transform block in question.
Except for irreversible matrix-based decorrelation transforms, all multi-component transform blocks described by the `Mstage_blocks' and `Mstage_xforms' parameter attributes must produce exactly one output component for each of their input components.
Mmatrix_size
Unable to access the matrix parameters identified by an `Mstage_xforms' parameter attribute.  Specifically, there should be an `Mmatrix_size' attribute, with instance index 
, corresponding to the total number of coefficients required to describe the irreversible decorrelation transform or reversible SERM transform in question -- note that reversible transforms are described by M*(M+1) coefficients, where M is the number of input (or output) components.
Mtriang_size
Unable to access the matrix parameters identified by an `Mstage_xforms' parameter attribute.  Specifically, there should be an `Mtriang_size' attribute, with instance index 
, corresponding to the total number of coefficients in the lower triangular matrix which describes the dependency transform in question.  For irreversible dependency transforms, the matrix should not contain any diagonal entries.  For reversible dependency transforms, however, all but the first diagonal entries should also be included, as normalization factors for the integer predictors.
nstps == block->dwt_num_steps
Multi-component transform stage contains multiple transform blocks which provide different definitions for the same stage output component.
Multi-component transform does not satisfy the constraints imposed by Part 2 of the JPEG2000 standard.  The first transform stage must touch every codestream image component (no more and no less), while subsequent stages must touch every component produced by the previous stage.
The last stage of the multi-component transform may not produce more output components than the number specified in the CBD marker segment (i.e. the `Mcomponents' value).
Although not strictly illegal, the present Part-2 codestream contains insufficient information to determine the dimensions of all image components output by the multi-component transform, based on main header marker segments.  The fact that this is not illegal is almost certainly an oversight in the development of the Part-2 syntax, but Kakadu cannot work with such codestreams.
