Internal error converting URL
File not found
Failed to get file info (stat failed)
File access failure; can't open, or I/O error
Failed to open CFBundle (unknown error).
Can't parse info dictionary XML
Info dictionary missing required property/value
A system kext has a property set that it shouldn't
Info dictionary property value is of illegal type
Info dictionary property value is illegal
CFBundleIdentifier and CFBundleVersion must be < 64 characters.
Kext has a CFBundleExecutable property but the executable can't be found
Kext claims a shared executable with named kext, but that kext can't be found
Kext declares both CFBundleExecutable and CFBundleSharedExecutableIdentifier; use only one.
Compatible version must be lower than current version.
Executable file doesn't contain kernel extension code (no kmod_info symbol or bad Mach-O layout).
Kext was not created from an URL and can't be authenticated
File owner/permissions are incorrect (must be root:wheel, nonwritable by group/other)
Info dictionary property value is of incorrect type
Kext is a kernel component but OSBundleIsInterface is set to false; overriding
Executable does not contain code for architecture
The booter does not recognize symbolic links; confirm these files/directories aren't needed for startup
Deprecated property (ignored)
Personality has no CFBundleIdentifier; the kext's identifier will be inserted when sending to the IOCatalogue
Personality CFBundleIdentifier names a kext that can't be found
Personality CFBundleIdentifier names a kext that is not loadable (run kextutil(8) on it with -nt for more information)
Personality CFBundleIdentifier names a kext that doesn't declare an executable
Personality CFBundleIdentifier differs from containing kext's (not necessarily a mistake, but rarely done)
Personality matches on IOResources but IOMatchCategory is missing or not equal to its IOClass; driver may be blocked from matching or may block others
Kext has no executable or compatible version, so it should not declare any OSBundleLibraries.
Kext declares no kernel/KPI libraries; if it references any kernel symbols, it may fail to link.
Kext declares no com.apple.kpi.* libraries; if it references any kernel symbols, it may fail to link.
Kexts should declare dependencies on either com.apple.kernel* or com.apple.kpi.* libraries, not both.
Kexts with a kernel library < v6.0 must set MODULE_NAME the same as CFBundleIdentifier to load on kernel < v6.0.
Kexts with a kernel library < v6.0 must set MODULE_VERSION the same as CFBundleVersion to load on kernel < v6.0.
Dependency lacks appropriate value for OSBundleRequired and may not be available during early boot
Kext is not signed
No kexts found for these libraries
Only incompatible kexts found for these libraries
Kexts found for these libraries lack valid OSBundleCompatibleVersion
Kexts already loaded for these libraries are not compatible with the requested version
Kexts already loaded for these libraries have no OSBundleCompatibleVersion
Indirect dependencies can't be resolved
Multiple kexts for these libraries occur in the dependency graph
Some dependencies are causing circular references
Libraries declared for both com.apple.kernel and a com.apple.kernel.* component.
Dependencies have validation problems
Dependencies have incorrect owner/permissions
64-bit kexts must use com.apple.kpi.* libraries, not com.apple.kernel* libraries.
Only Apple kexts may link against com.apple.kpi.private.
Kexts may not link against com.apple.kernel; use either com.apple.kpi.* libraries (recommended), or com.apple.kernel.* (for compatiblity with older releases).
Interface kext must have exactly one dependency.
Kext isn't loadable during safe boot.
