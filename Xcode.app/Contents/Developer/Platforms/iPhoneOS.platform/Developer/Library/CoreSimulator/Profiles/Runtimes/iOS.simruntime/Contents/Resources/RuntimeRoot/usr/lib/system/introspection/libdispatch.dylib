LIBDISPATCH_DEBUG_QUEUE_INVERSIONS
BUG IN CLIENT OF LIBDISPATCH: queue inversion debugging cannot be used with code that changes the target of a queue already targeted by other dispatch objects
queue %p[%s] was already targeted by other dispatch objects
both an initiator and a recipient
BUG IN CLIENT OF LIBDISPATCH: queue inversion debugging expects queues to not participate in dispatch_sync() before their setup is complete
forgetting that queue 0x%p[%s] participated as %s of a dispatch_sync
TRUE
BUG IN LIBDISPATCH: Handled by the caller
