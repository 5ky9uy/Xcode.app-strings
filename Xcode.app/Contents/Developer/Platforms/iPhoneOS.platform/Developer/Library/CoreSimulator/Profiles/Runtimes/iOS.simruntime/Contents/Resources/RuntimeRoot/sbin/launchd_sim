XPC bundles can't have KeepAlive, they can't even set it as a plist key, how did we get here?
EnablePressuredExit is not compatible with KeepAlive=true. Ignoring EnablePressuredExit.
Assuming EnablePressuredExit=false given EnableTransactions=false.
Service sets EnableTransactions=false and EnablePressuredExit=true, which makes no sense. Enabling Transactions.
Service specifies LimitLoadToHardware which does not make sense for this launchd instance
