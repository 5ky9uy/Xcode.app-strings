                             --strip 1 would change the path
                             'doc/fudge/crunchy.html' to 'fudge/crunchy.html'.
                             --strip 2 would leave just 'crunchy.html'
                             The expected component separator is '/' on all
                             platforms. A leading '/' counts as one component.

                                             date of 'last-changed-revision'
                                'last-changed-author'
                                             author of 'last-changed-revision'
                                'wc-root'    root of TARGET's working copy
adds-as-modification
Local additions are merged with incoming additions
                             instead of causing a tree conflict. Use of this
                             option is not recommended! Use 'svn resolve' to
                             resolve tree conflicts instead.
vacuum-pristines

Put files and directories under version control, scheduling
them for addition to repository.  They will be added in next commit.
usage: add PATH...
add intermediate parents
Manage cached authentication credentials.
usage: 1. svn auth [PATTERN ...]
usage: 2. svn auth --remove PATTERN [PATTERN ...]
  With no arguments, list all cached authentication credentials.
  Authentication credentials include usernames, passwords,
  SSL certificates, and SSL client-certificate passphrases.
  If PATTERN is specified, only list credentials with attributes matching one
  or more patterns. With the --remove option, remove cached authentication
  credentials matching one or more patterns.
  If more than one pattern is specified credentials are considered only if they
  match all specified patterns. Patterns are matched case-sensitively and may
  contain glob wildcards:
    ?      matches any single character
    *      matches a sequence of arbitrary characters
    [abc]  matches any of the characters listed inside the brackets
  Note that wildcards will usually need to be quoted or escaped on the
  command line because many command shells will interfere by trying to
  expand them.
remove matching authentication credentials
praise
annotate
Show when each line of a file was last (or
next) changed.
usage: blame [-rM:N] TARGET[@REV]...
  Annotate each line of a file with the revision number and author of the
  last change (or optionally the next change) to that line.
  With no revision range (same as -r0:REV), or with '-r M:N' where M < N,
  annotate each line that is present in revision N of the file, with
  the last revision at or before rN that changed or added the line,
  looking back no further than rM.
  With a reverse revision range '-r M:N' where M > N,
  annotate each line that is present in revision N of the file, with
  the next revision after rN that changed or deleted the line,
  looking forward no further than rM.
  If specified, REV determines in which revision the target is first
  looked up.
  Write the annotated result to standard output.
Output the content of specified files or URLs.
usage: cat TARGET[@REV]...
  If specified, REV determines in which revision the target is first
  looked up.
Associate (or dissociate) changelist CLNAME with the named files.
usage: 1. changelist CLNAME PATH...
       2. changelist --remove PATH...
checkout
Check out a working copy from a repository.
usage: checkout URL[@REV]... [PATH]
  If specified, REV determines in which revision the URL is first
  looked up.
  If PATH is omitted, the basename of the URL will be used as
  the destination. If multiple URLs are given each will be checked
  out into a sub-directory of PATH, with the name of the sub-directory
  being the basename of the URL.
  If --force is used, unversioned obstructing paths in the working
  copy destination do not automatically cause the check out to fail.
  If the obstructing path is the same type (file or directory) as the
  corresponding path in the repository it becomes versioned but its
  contents are left 'as-is' in the working copy.  This means that an
  obstructing directory's unversioned children may also obstruct and
  become versioned.  For files, any content differences between the
  obstruction and the repository are treated like a local modification
  to the working copy.  All properties from the repository are applied
  to the obstructing path.
  See also 'svn help update' for a list of possible characters
  reporting the action taken.
cleanup
Either recover from an interrupted operation that left the working copy locked,
or remove unwanted files.
usage: 1. cleanup [WCPATH...]
       2. cleanup --remove-unversioned [WCPATH...]
          cleanup --remove-ignored [WCPATH...]
       3. cleanup --vacuum-pristines [WCPATH...]
  1. When none of the options --remove-unversioned, --remove-ignored, and
    --vacuum-pristines is specified, remove all write locks (shown as 'L' by
    the 'svn status' command) from the working copy.  Usually, this is only
    necessary if a Subversion client has crashed while using the working copy,
    leaving it in an unusable state.
    WARNING: There is no mechanism that will protect write locks still
             being used by other Subversion clients. Running this command
             without any options while another client is using the working
             copy can corrupt the working copy beyond repair!
  2. If the --remove-unversioned option or the --remove-ignored option
    is given, remove any unversioned or ignored items within WCPATH.
    Note that the 'svn status' command shows unversioned items as '?',
    and ignored items as 'I' if the --no-ignore option is given to it.
  3. If the --vacuum-pristines option is given, remove pristine copies of
    files which are stored inside the .svn directory and which are no longer
    referenced by any file in the working copy.
deprecated and ignored
Send changes from your working copy to the repository.
usage: commit [PATH...]
  A log message must be provided, but it can be empty.  If it is not
  given by a --message or --file option, an editor will be started.
  If any targets are (or contain) locked items, those will be
  unlocked after a successful commit, unless --no-unlock is given.
  If --include-externals is given, also commit file and directory
  externals reached by recursion. Do not commit externals with a
  fixed revision.
copy
Copy files and directories in a working copy or repository.
usage: copy SRC[@REV]... DST
  SRC and DST can each be either a working copy (WC) path or URL:
    WC  -> WC:   copy and schedule for addition (with history)
    WC  -> URL:  immediately commit a copy of WC to URL
    URL -> WC:   check out URL into WC, schedule for addition
    URL -> URL:  complete server-side copy;  used to branch and tag
  All the SRCs must be of the same type. If DST is an existing directory,
  the sources will be added as children of DST. When copying multiple
  sources, DST must be an existing directory.
  WARNING: For compatibility with previous versions of Subversion,
  copies performed using two working copy paths (WC -> WC) will not
  contact the repository.  As such, they may not, by default, be able
  to propagate merge tracking information from the source of the copy
  to the destination.
Remove files and directories from version control.
usage: 1. delete PATH...
       2. delete URL...
  1. Each item specified by a PATH is scheduled for deletion upon
    the next commit.  Files, and directories that have not been
    committed, are immediately removed from the working copy
    unless the --keep-local option is given.
    PATHs that are, or contain, unversioned or modified items will
    not be removed unless the --force or --keep-local option is given.
  2. Each item specified by a URL is deleted from the repository
    via an immediate commit.
Display local changes or differences between two revisions or paths.
usage: 1. diff
       2. diff [-c M | -r N[:M]] [TARGET[@REV]...]
       3. diff [-r N[:M]] --old=OLD-TGT[@OLDREV] [--new=NEW-TGT[@NEWREV]] \
               [PATH...]
       4. diff OLD-URL[@OLDREV] NEW-URL[@NEWREV]
       5. diff OLD-URL[@OLDREV] NEW-PATH[@NEWREV]
       6. diff OLD-PATH[@OLDREV] NEW-URL[@NEWREV]
  1. Use just 'svn diff' to display local modifications in a working copy.
  2. Display the changes made to TARGETs as they are seen in REV between
     two revisions.  TARGETs may be all working copy paths or all URLs.
     If TARGETs are working copy paths, N defaults to BASE and M to the
     working copy; if URLs, N must be specified and M defaults to HEAD.
     The '-c M' option is equivalent to '-r N:M' where N = M-1.
     Using '-c -M' does the reverse: '-r M:N' where N = M-1.
  3. Display the differences between OLD-TGT as it was seen in OLDREV and
     NEW-TGT as it was seen in NEWREV.  PATHs, if given, are relative to
     OLD-TGT and NEW-TGT and restrict the output to differences for those
     paths.  OLD-TGT and NEW-TGT may be working copy paths or URL[@REV].
     NEW-TGT defaults to OLD-TGT if not specified.  -r N makes OLDREV default
     to N, -r N:M makes OLDREV default to N and NEWREV default to M.
     If OLDREV or NEWREV are not specified, they default to WORKING for
     working copy targets and to HEAD for URL targets.
     Either or both OLD-TGT and NEW-TGT may also be paths to unversioned
     targets. Revisions cannot be specified for unversioned targets.
     Both targets must be of the same node kind (file or directory).
     Diffing unversioned targets against URL targets is not supported.
  4. Shorthand for 'svn diff --old=OLD-URL[@OLDREV] --new=NEW-URL[@NEWREV]'
  5. Shorthand for 'svn diff --old=OLD-URL[@OLDREV] --new=NEW-PATH[@NEWREV]'
  6. Shorthand for 'svn diff --old=OLD-PATH[@OLDREV] --new=NEW-URL[@NEWREV]'
export
Create an unversioned copy of a tree.
usage: 1. export [-r REV] URL[@PEGREV] [PATH]
       2. export [-r REV] PATH1[@PEGREV] [PATH2]
  1. Exports a clean directory tree from the repository specified by
     URL, at revision REV if it is given, otherwise at HEAD, into
     PATH. If PATH is omitted, the last component of the URL is used
     for the local directory name.
  2. Exports a clean directory tree from the working copy specified by
     PATH1, at revision REV if it is given, otherwise at WORKING, into
     PATH2.  If PATH2 is omitted, the last component of the PATH1 is used
     for the local directory name. If REV is not specified, all local
     changes will be preserved.  Files not under version control will
     not be copied.
  If specified, PEGREV determines in which revision the target is first
  looked up.
Describe the usage of this program or its subcommands.
usage: help [SUBCOMMAND...]
import
Commit an unversioned file or tree into the repository.
usage: import [PATH] URL
  Recursively commit a copy of PATH to URL.
  If PATH is omitted '.' is assumed.
  Parent directories are created as necessary in the repository.
  If PATH is a directory, the contents of the directory are added
  directly under URL.
  Unversionable items such as device files and pipes are ignored
  if --force is specified.
Display information about a local or remote item.
usage: info [TARGET[@REV]...]
  Print information about each TARGET (default: '.').
  TARGET may be either a working-copy path or a URL.  If specified, REV
  determines in which revision the target is first looked up; the default
  is HEAD for a URL or BASE for a WC path.
  With --show-item, print only the value of one item of information
  about TARGET.
List directory entries in the repository.
usage: list [TARGET[@REV]...]
  List each TARGET file and the contents of each TARGET directory as
  they exist in the repository.  If TARGET is a working copy path, the
  corresponding repository URL will be used. If specified, REV determines
  in which revision the target is first looked up.
  The default TARGET is '.', meaning the repository URL of the current
  working directory.
  Multiple --search patterns may be specified and the output will be
  reduced to those paths whose last segment - i.e. the file or directory
  name - matches at least one of these patterns.
  With --verbose, the following fields will be shown for each item:
    Revision number of the last commit
    Author of the last commit
    If locked, the letter 'O'.  (Use 'svn info URL' to see details)
    Size (in bytes)
    Date and time of the last commit
Lock working copy paths or URLs in the repository, so that
no other user can commit changes to them.
usage: lock TARGET...
  Use --force to steal a lock from another user or working copy.
read lock comment from file ARG
specify lock comment ARG
force validity of lock comment source
steal locks
Show the log messages for a set of revision(s) and/or path(s).
usage: 1. log [PATH][@REV]
       2. log URL[@REV] [PATH...]
  1. Print the log messages for the URL corresponding to PATH
     (default: '.'). If specified, REV is the revision in which the
     URL is first looked up, and the default revision range is REV:1.
     If REV is not specified, the default revision range is BASE:1,
     since the URL might not exist in the HEAD revision.
  2. Print the log messages for the PATHs (default: '.') under URL.
     If specified, REV is the revision in which the URL is first
     looked up, and the default revision range is REV:1; otherwise,
     the URL is looked up in HEAD, and the default revision range is
     HEAD:1.
  Multiple '-c' or '-r' options may be specified (but not a
  combination of '-c' and '-r' options), and mixing of forward and
  reverse ranges is allowed.
  With -v, also print all affected paths with each log message.
  Each changed path is preceded with a symbol describing the change:
    A: The path was added or copied.
    D: The path was deleted.
    R: The path was replaced (deleted and re-added in the same revision).
    M: The path's file and/or property content was modified.
  If an added or replaced path was copied from somewhere else, the copy
  source path and revision are shown in parentheses.
  If a file or directory was moved from one path to another with 'svn move'
  the old path will be listed as deleted and the new path will be listed
  as copied from the old path at a prior revision.
  With -q, don't print the log message body itself (note that this is
  compatible with -v).
  Each log message is printed just once, even if more than one of the
  affected paths for that revision were explicitly requested.  Logs
  follow copy history by default.  Use --stop-on-copy to disable this
  behavior, which can be useful for determining branchpoints.
  The --depth option is only valid in combination with the --diff option
  and limits the scope of the displayed diff to the specified depth.
  If the --search option is used, log messages are displayed only if the
  provided search pattern matches any of the author, date, log message
  text (unless --quiet is used), or, if the --verbose option is also
  provided, a changed path.
  The search pattern may include "glob syntax" wildcards:
      ?      matches any single character
      *      matches a sequence of arbitrary characters
      [abc]  matches any of the characters listed inside the brackets
  If multiple --search options are provided, a log message is shown if
  it matches any of the provided search patterns. If the --search-and
  option is used, that option's argument is combined with the pattern
  from the previous --search or --search-and option, and a log message
  is shown only if it matches the combined search pattern.
  If --limit is used in combination with --search, --limit restricts the
  number of log messages searched, rather than restricting the output
  to a particular number of matching log messages.
  Examples:
    Show the latest 5 log messages for the current working copy
    directory and display paths changed in each commit:
      svn log -l 5 -v
    Show the log for bar.c as of revision 42:
      svn log bar.c@42
    Show log messages and diffs for each commit to foo.c:
      svn log --diff http://www.example.com/repo/project/foo.c
    (Because the above command uses a full URL it does not require

merge
Merge changes into a working copy.
usage: 1. merge SOURCE[@REV] [TARGET_WCPATH]
          (the 'complete' merge)
       2. merge [-c M[,N...] | -r N:M ...] SOURCE[@REV] [TARGET_WCPATH]
          (the 'cherry-pick' merge)
       3. merge SOURCE1[@REV1] SOURCE2[@REV2] [TARGET_WCPATH]
          (the '2-URL' merge)
  1. This form, with one source path and no revision range, is called
     a 'complete' merge:
       svn merge SOURCE[@REV] [TARGET_WCPATH]
     The complete merge is used for the 'sync' and 'reintegrate' merges
     in the 'feature branch' pattern described below. It finds all the
     changes on the source branch that have not already been merged to the
     target branch, and merges them into the working copy. Merge tracking
     is used to know which changes have already been merged.
     SOURCE specifies the branch from where the changes will be pulled, and
     TARGET_WCPATH specifies a working copy of the target branch to which
     the changes will be applied. Normally SOURCE and TARGET_WCPATH should
     each correspond to the root of a branch. (If you want to merge only a
     subtree, then the subtree path must be included in both SOURCE and
     TARGET_WCPATH; this is discouraged, to avoid subtree mergeinfo.)
     SOURCE is usually a URL. The optional '@REV' specifies both the peg
     revision of the URL and the latest revision that will be considered
     for merging; if REV is not specified, the HEAD revision is assumed. If
     SOURCE is a working copy path, the corresponding URL of the path is
     used, and the default value of 'REV' is the base revision (usually the
     revision last updated to).
     TARGET_WCPATH is a working copy path; if omitted, '.' is generally
     assumed. There are some special cases:
       - If SOURCE is a URL:
           - If the basename of the URL and the basename of '.' are the
             same, then the differences are applied to '.'. Otherwise,
             if a file with the same basename as that of the URL is found
             within '.', then the differences are applied to that file.
             In all other cases, the target defaults to '.'.
       - If SOURCE is a working copy path:
           - If the source is a file, then differences are applied to that
             file (useful for reverse-merging earlier changes). Otherwise,
             if the source is a directory, then the target defaults to '.'.
     In normal usage the working copy should be up to date, at a single
     revision, with no local modifications and no switched subtrees.
       - The 'Feature Branch' Merging Pattern -
     In this commonly used work flow, known also as the 'development
     branch' pattern, a developer creates a branch and commits a series of
     changes that implement a new feature. The developer periodically
     merges all the latest changes from the parent branch so as to keep the
     development branch up to date with those changes. When the feature is
     complete, the developer performs a merge from the feature branch to
     the parent branch to re-integrate the changes.
         parent --+----------o------o-o-------------o--
                   \            \           \      /
                    \          merge      merge  merge
                     \            \           \  /
         feature      +--o-o-------o----o-o----o-------
     A merge from the parent branch to the feature branch is called a
     'sync' or 'catch-up' merge, and a merge from the feature branch to the
     parent branch is called a 'reintegrate' merge.
       - Sync Merge Example -
                                 ............
                                .            .
         trunk  --+------------L--------------R------
                   \                           \
                    \                          |
                     \                         v
         feature      +------------------------o-----
                             r100            r200
     Subversion will locate all the changes on 'trunk' that have not yet
     been merged into the 'feature' branch. In this case that is a single
     range, r100:200. In the diagram above, L marks the left side (trunk@100)
     and R marks the right side (trunk@200) of the merge source. The
     difference between L and R will be applied to the target working copy
     path. In this case, the working copy is a clean checkout of the entire
     'feature' branch.
     To perform this sync merge, have a clean working copy of the feature
     branch and run the following command in its top-level directory:
         svn merge ^/trunk
     Note that the merge is now only in your local working copy and still
     needs to be committed to the repository so that it can be seen by
     others. You can review the changes and you may have to resolve
     conflicts before you commit the merge.
       - Reintegrate Merge Example -
     The feature branch was last synced with trunk up to revision X. So the
     difference between trunk@X and feature@HEAD contains the complete set
     of changes that implement the feature, and no other changes. These
     changes are applied to trunk.
                    rW                   rX
         trunk ------+--------------------L------------------o
                      \                    .                 ^
                       \                    .............   /
                        \                                . /
         feature         +--------------------------------R
     In the diagram above, L marks the left side (trunk@X) and R marks the
     right side (feature@HEAD) of the merge. The difference between the
     left and right side is merged into trunk, the target.
     To perform the merge, have a clean working copy of trunk and run the
     following command in its top-level directory:
         svn merge ^/feature
     To prevent unnecessary merge conflicts, a reintegrate merge requires
     that TARGET_WCPATH is not a mixed-revision working copy, has no local
     modifications, and has no switched subtrees.
     A reintegrate merge also requires that the source branch is coherently
     synced with the target -- in the above example, this means that all
     revisions between the branch point W and the last merged revision X
     are merged to the feature branch, so that there are no unmerged
     revisions in-between.
  2. This form is called a 'cherry-pick' merge:
       svn merge [-c M[,N...] | -r N:M ...] SOURCE[@REV] [TARGET_WCPATH]
     A cherry-pick merge is used to merge specific revisions (or revision
     ranges) from one branch to another. By default, this uses merge
     tracking to automatically skip any revisions that have already been
     merged to the target; you can use the --ignore-ancestry option to
     disable such skipping.
     SOURCE is usually a URL. The optional '@REV' specifies only the peg
     revision of the URL and does not affect the merge range; if REV is not
     specified, the HEAD revision is assumed. If SOURCE is a working copy
     path, the corresponding URL of the path is used, and the default value
     of 'REV' is the base revision (usually the revision last updated to).
     TARGET_WCPATH is a working copy path; if omitted, '.' is generally
     assumed. The special cases noted above in the 'complete' merge form
     also apply here.
     The revision ranges to be merged are specified by the '-r' and/or '-c'
     options. '-r N:M' refers to the difference in the history of the
     source branch between revisions N and M. You can use '-c M' to merge
     single revisions: '-c M' is equivalent to '-r <M-1>:M'. Each such
     difference is applied to TARGET_WCPATH.
     If the mergeinfo in TARGET_WCPATH indicates that revisions within the
     range were already merged, changes made in those revisions are not
     merged again. If needed, the range is broken into multiple sub-ranges,
     and each sub-range is merged separately.
     A 'reverse range' can be used to undo changes. For example, when
     source and target refer to the same branch, a previously committed
     revision can be 'undone'. In a reverse range, N is greater than M in
     '-r N:M', or the '-c' option is used with a negative number: '-c -M'
     is equivalent to '-r M:<M-1>'. Undoing changes like this is also known
     as performing a 'reverse merge'.
     Multiple '-c' and/or '-r' options may be specified and mixing of
     forward and reverse ranges is allowed.
       - Cherry-pick Merge Example -
     A bug has been fixed on trunk in revision 50. This fix needs to
     be merged from trunk onto the release branch.
            1.x-release  +-----------------------o-----
                        /                        ^
                       /                         |
                      /                          |
         trunk ------+--------------------------LR-----
                                                r50
     In the above diagram, L marks the left side (trunk@49) and R marks the
     right side (trunk@50) of the merge. The difference between the left
     and right side is applied to the target working copy path.
     Note that the difference between revision 49 and 50 is exactly those
     changes that were committed in revision 50, not including changes
     committed in revision 49.
     To perform the merge, have a clean working copy of the release branch
     and run the following command in its top-level directory; remember
     that the default target is '.':
         svn merge -c50 ^/trunk
     You can also cherry-pick several revisions and/or revision ranges:
         svn merge -c50,54,60 -r65:68 ^/trunk
  3. This form is called a '2-URL merge':
       svn merge SOURCE1[@REV1] SOURCE2[@REV2] [TARGET_WCPATH]
     You should use this merge variant only if the other variants do not
     apply to your situation, as this variant can be quite complex to
     master.
     Two source URLs are specified, identifying two trees on the same
     branch or on different branches. The trees are compared and the
     difference from SOURCE1@REV1 to SOURCE2@REV2 is applied to the
     working copy of the target branch at TARGET_WCPATH. The target
     branch may be the same as one or both sources, or different again.
     The three branches involved can be completely unrelated.
     TARGET_WCPATH is a working copy path; if omitted, '.' is generally
     assumed. The special cases noted above in the 'complete' merge form
     also apply here.
     SOURCE1 and/or SOURCE2 can also be specified as a working copy path,
     in which case the merge source URL is derived from the working copy.
       - 2-URL Merge Example -
     Two features have been developed on separate branches called 'foo' and
     'bar'. It has since become clear that 'bar' should be combined with
     the 'foo' branch for further development before reintegration.
     Although both feature branches originate from trunk, they are not
     directly related -- one is not a direct copy of the other. A 2-URL
     merge is necessary.
     The 'bar' branch has been synced with trunk up to revision 500.
     (If this revision number is not known, it can be located using the
     'svn log' and/or 'svn mergeinfo' commands.)
     The difference between trunk@500 and bar@HEAD contains the complete
     set of changes related to feature 'bar', and no other changes. These
     changes are applied to the 'foo' branch.
                           foo  +-----------------------------------o
                               /                                    ^
                              /                                    /
                             /              r500                  /
         trunk ------+------+-----------------L--------->        /
                      \                        .                /
                       \                        ............   /
                        \                                   . /
                    bar  +-----------------------------------R
     In the diagram above, L marks the left side (trunk@500) and R marks
     the right side (bar@HEAD) of the merge. The difference between the
     left and right side is applied to the target working copy path, in
     this case a working copy of the 'foo' branch.
     To perform the merge, have a clean working copy of the 'foo' branch
     and run the following command in its top-level directory:
         svn merge ^/trunk@500 ^/bar
     The exact changes applied by a 2-URL merge can be previewed with svn's
     diff command, which is a good idea to verify if you do not have the
     luxury of a clean working copy to merge to. In this case:
         svn diff ^/trunk@500 ^/bar@HEAD
  The following applies to all types of merges:
  To prevent unnecessary merge conflicts, svn merge requires that
  TARGET_WCPATH is not a mixed-revision working copy. Running 'svn update'
  before starting a merge ensures that all items in the working copy are
  based on the same revision.
  If possible, you should have no local modifications in the merge's target
  working copy prior to the merge, to keep things simpler. It will be
  easier to revert the merge and to understand the branch's history.
  Switched sub-paths should also be avoided during merging, as they may
  cause incomplete merges and create subtree mergeinfo.
  For each merged item a line will be printed with characters reporting the
  action taken. These characters have the following meaning:
    A  Added
    D  Deleted
    U  Updated
    C  Conflict
    G  Merged
    E  Existed
    R  Replaced
  Characters in the first column report about the item itself.
  Characters in the second column report about properties of the item.
  A 'C' in the third column indicates a tree conflict, while a 'C' in
  the first and second columns indicate textual conflicts in files
  and in property values, respectively.
    - Merge Tracking -
  Subversion uses the svn:mergeinfo property to track merge history. This
  property is considered at the start of a merge to determine what to merge
  and it is updated at the conclusion of the merge to describe the merge
  that took place. Mergeinfo is used only if the two sources are on the
  same line of history -- if the first source is an ancestor of the second,
  or vice-versa (i.e. if one has originally been created by copying the
  other). This is verified and enforced when using sync merges and
  reintegrate merges.
  The --ignore-ancestry option prevents merge tracking and thus ignores
  mergeinfo, neither considering it nor recording it.
    - Merging from foreign repositories -
  Subversion does support merging from foreign repositories.
  While all merge source URLs must point to the same repository, the merge
  target working copy may come from a different repository than the source.
  However, there are some caveats. Most notably, copies made in the
  merge source will be transformed into plain additions in the merge
  target. Also, merge-tracking is not supported for merges from foreign
  repositories.
force deletions even if deleted contents don't match
mergeinfo
Display merge-related information.
usage: 1. mergeinfo SOURCE[@REV] [TARGET[@REV]]
       2. mergeinfo --show-revs=WHICH SOURCE[@REV] [TARGET[@REV]]
  1. Summarize the history of merging between SOURCE and TARGET. The graph
     shows, from left to right:
       the youngest common ancestor of the branches;
       the latest full merge in either direction, and thus the common base
         that will be used for the next complete merge;
       the repository path and revision number of the tip of each branch.
  2. Print the revision numbers on SOURCE that have been merged to TARGET
     (with --show-revs=merged), or that have not been merged to TARGET
     (with --show-revs=eligible). Print only revisions in which there was
     at least one change in SOURCE.
     If --revision (-r) is provided, filter the displayed information to
     show only that which is associated with the revisions within the
     specified range.  Revision numbers, dates, and the 'HEAD' keyword are
     valid range values.
  SOURCE and TARGET are the source and target branch URLs, respectively.
  (If a WC path is given, the corresponding base URL is used.) The default
  TARGET is the current working directory ('.'). REV specifies the revision
  to be considered the tip of the branch; the default for SOURCE is HEAD,
  and the default for TARGET is HEAD for a URL or BASE for a WC path.
  The depth can be 'empty' or 'infinity'; the default is 'empty'.
mkdir
Create a new directory under version control.
usage: 1. mkdir PATH...
       2. mkdir URL...
  Create version controlled directories.
  1. Each directory specified by a working copy PATH is created locally
    and scheduled for addition upon the next commit.
  2. Each directory specified by a URL is created in the repository via
    an immediate commit.
  In both cases, all the intermediate directories must already exist,
  unless the --parents option is given.
move
rename
Move (rename) an item in a working copy or repository.
usage: move SRC... DST
  SRC and DST can both be working copy (WC) paths or URLs:
    WC  -> WC:  move an item in a working copy, as a local change to
                be committed later (with or without further changes)
    URL -> URL: move an item in the repository directly, immediately
                creating a new revision in the repository
  All the SRCs must be of the same type. If DST is an existing directory,
  the sources will be added as children of DST. When moving multiple
  sources, DST must be an existing directory.
  SRC and DST of WC -> WC moves must be committed in the same revision.
  Furthermore, WC -> WC moves will refuse to move a mixed-revision subtree.
  To avoid unnecessary conflicts, it is recommended to run 'svn update'
  to update the subtree to a single revision before moving it.
  The --allow-mixed-revisions option is provided for backward compatibility.
patch
Apply a patch to a working copy.
usage: patch PATCHFILE [WCPATH]
  Apply a unidiff patch in PATCHFILE to the working copy WCPATH.
  If WCPATH is omitted, '.' is assumed.
  A unidiff patch suitable for application to a working copy can be
  produced with the 'svn diff' command or third-party diffing tools.
  Any non-unidiff content of PATCHFILE is ignored, except for Subversion
  property diffs as produced by 'svn diff'.
  Changes listed in the patch will either be applied or rejected.
  If a change does not match at its exact line offset, it may be applied
  earlier or later in the file if a match is found elsewhere for the
  surrounding lines of context provided by the patch.
  A change may also be applied with fuzz, which means that one
  or more lines of context are ignored when matching the change.
  If no matching context can be found for a change, the change conflicts
  and will be written to a reject file with the extension .svnpatch.rej.
  For each patched file a line will be printed with characters reporting
  the action taken. These characters have the following meaning:
    A  Added
    D  Deleted
    U  Updated
    C  Conflict
    G  Merged (with local uncommitted changes)
  Changes applied with an offset or fuzz are reported on lines starting
  with the '>' symbol. You should review such changes carefully.
  If the patch removes all content from a file, that file is scheduled
  for deletion. If the patch creates a new file, that file is scheduled
  for addition. Use 'svn revert' to undo deletions and additions you
  do not agree with.
  Hint: If the patch file was created with Subversion, it will contain
        the number of a revision N the patch will cleanly apply to
        (look for lines like '--- foo/bar.txt        (revision N)').
        To avoid rejects, first update to the revision N using
        'svn update -r N', apply the patch, and then update back to the
        HEAD revision. This way, conflicts can be resolved interactively.
propdel
pdel
Remove a property from files, dirs, or revisions.
usage: 1. propdel PROPNAME [PATH...]
       2. propdel PROPNAME --revprop -r REV [TARGET]
  1. Removes versioned props in working copy.
  2. Removes unversioned remote prop on repos revision.
     TARGET only determines which repository to access.
  See 'svn help propset' for descriptions of the svn:* special properties.
propedit
pedit
Edit a property with an external editor.
usage: 1. propedit PROPNAME TARGET...
       2. propedit PROPNAME --revprop -r REV [TARGET]
  1. Edits versioned prop in working copy or repository.
  2. Edits unversioned remote prop on repos revision.
     TARGET only determines which repository to access.
  See 'svn help propset' for descriptions of the svn:* special properties.
propget
pget
Print the value of a property on files, dirs, or revisions.
usage: 1. propget PROPNAME [TARGET[@REV]...]
       2. propget PROPNAME --revprop -r REV [TARGET]
  1. Prints versioned props. If specified, REV determines in which
     revision the target is first looked up.
  2. Prints unversioned remote prop on repos revision.
     TARGET only determines which repository to access.
  With --verbose, the target path and the property name are printed on
  separate lines before each value, like 'svn proplist --verbose'.
  Otherwise, if there is more than one TARGET or a depth other than
  'empty', the target path is printed on the same line before each value.
  By default, an extra newline is printed after the property value so that
  the output looks pretty.  With a single TARGET, depth 'empty' and without
  --show-inherited-props, you can use the --no-newline option to disable this
  (useful when redirecting a binary property value to a file, for example).
  See 'svn help propset' for descriptions of the svn:* special properties.
print path, name and value on separate lines
(deprecated; use --no-newline)
proplist
plist
List all properties on files, dirs, or revisions.
usage: 1. proplist [TARGET[@REV]...]
       2. proplist --revprop -r REV [TARGET]
  1. Lists versioned props. If specified, REV determines in which
     revision the target is first looked up.
  2. Lists unversioned remote props on repos revision.
     TARGET only determines which repository to access.
  With --verbose, the property values are printed as well, like 'svn propget
  --verbose'.  With --quiet, the paths are not printed.
  See 'svn help propset' for descriptions of the svn:* special properties.
don't print the path
propset
pset
Set the value of a property on files, dirs, or revisions.
usage: 1. propset PROPNAME PROPVAL PATH...
       2. propset PROPNAME --revprop -r REV PROPVAL [TARGET]
  1. Changes a versioned file or directory property in a working copy.
  2. Changes an unversioned property on a repository revision.
     (TARGET only determines which repository to access.)
  The value may be provided with the --file option instead of PROPVAL.
  Property names starting with 'svn:' are reserved.  Subversion recognizes
  the following special versioned properties on a file:
    svn:keywords   - Keywords to be expanded.  Valid keywords are:
      URL, HeadURL             - The URL for the head version of the file.
      Author, LastChangedBy    - The last person to modify the file.
      Date, LastChangedDate    - The date/time the file was last modified.
      Rev, Revision,           - The last revision the file changed.
        LastChangedRevision
      Id                       - A compressed summary of the previous four.
      Header                   - Similar to Id but includes the full URL.
      Custom keywords can be defined with a format string separated from
      the keyword name with '='. Valid format substitutions are:
        %a   - The author of the revision given by %r.
        %b   - The basename of the URL of the file.
        %d   - Short format of the date of the revision given by %r.
        %D   - Long format of the date of the revision given by %r.
        %P   - The file's path, relative to the repository root.
        %r   - The number of the revision which last changed the file.
        %R   - The URL to the root of the repository.
        %u   - The URL of the file.
        %_   - A space (keyword definitions cannot contain a literal space).
        %%   - A literal '%'.
        %H   - Equivalent to %P%_%r%_%d%_%a.
        %I   - Equivalent to %b%_%r%_%d%_%a.
      Example custom keyword definition: MyKeyword=%r%_%a%_%P
      Once a custom keyword has been defined for a file, it can be used
      within the file like any other keyword: $MyKeyword$
    svn:executable - If present, make the file executable.  Use
      'svn propdel svn:executable PATH...' to clear.
    svn:eol-style  - One of 'native', 'LF', 'CR', 'CRLF'.
    svn:mime-type  - The mimetype of the file.  Used to determine
      whether to merge the file, and how to serve it from Apache.
      A mimetype beginning with 'text/' (or an absent mimetype) is
      treated as text.  Anything else is treated as binary.
    svn:needs-lock - If present, indicates that the file should be locked
      before it is modified.  Makes the working copy file read-only
      when it is not locked.  Use 'svn propdel svn:needs-lock PATH...'
      to clear.
  Subversion recognizes the following special versioned properties on a
  directory:
    svn:ignore         - A list of file glob patterns to ignore, one per line.
    svn:global-ignores - Like svn:ignore, but inheritable.
    svn:auto-props     - Automatically set properties on files when they are
      added or imported. Contains key-value pairs, one per line, in the format:
        PATTERN = PROPNAME=VALUE[;PROPNAME=VALUE ...]
      Example (where a literal ';' is escaped by adding another ';'):
        *.html = svn:eol-style=native;svn:mime-type=text/html;; charset=UTF8
      Applies recursively to all files added or imported under the directory
      it is set on.  See also [auto-props] in the client configuration file.
    svn:externals      - A list of module specifiers, one per line, in the
      following format similar to the syntax of 'svn checkout':
        [-r REV] URL[@PEG] LOCALPATH
      Example:
        http://example.com/repos/zig foo/bar
      The LOCALPATH is relative to the directory having this property.
      To pin the external to a known revision, specify the optional REV:
        -r25 http://example.com/repos/zig foo/bar
      To unambiguously identify an element at a path which may have been
      subsequently deleted or renamed, specify the optional PEG revision:
        -r25 http://example.com/repos/zig@42 foo/bar
      The URL may be a full URL or a relative URL starting with one of:
        ../  to the parent directory of the extracted external
        ^/   to the repository root
        /    to the server root
        //   to the URL scheme
      ^/../  to a sibling repository beneath the same SVNParentPath location
      Use of the following format is discouraged but is supported for
      interoperability with Subversion 1.4 and earlier clients:
        LOCALPATH [-r PEG] URL
      The ambiguous format 'relative_path relative_path' is taken as
      'relative_url relative_path' with peg revision support.
      Lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.
read property value from file ARG
Relocate the working copy to point to a different repository root URL.
usage: 1. relocate FROM-PREFIX TO-PREFIX [PATH...]
       2. relocate TO-URL [PATH]
  Rewrite working copy URL metadata to reflect a syntactic change only.
  This is used when a repository's root URL changes (such as a scheme
  or hostname change) but your working copy still reflects the same
  directory within the same repository.
  1. FROM-PREFIX and TO-PREFIX are initial substrings of the working
     copy's current and new URLs, respectively.  (You may specify the
     complete old and new URLs if you wish.)  Use 'svn info' to determine
     the current working copy URL.
  2. TO-URL is the (complete) new repository URL to use for PATH.
  Examples:
    svn relocate http:// svn:// project1 project2
    svn relocate http://www.example.com/repo/project \
                 svn://svn.example.com/repo/project
resolve
Resolve conflicts on working copy files or directories.
usage: resolve [PATH...]
  By default, perform interactive conflict resolution on PATH.
  In this mode, the command is recursive by default (depth 'infinity').
  The --accept=ARG option prevents interactive prompting and forces
  conflicts on PATH to be resolved in the manner specified by ARG.
  In this mode, the command is not recursive by default (depth 'empty').
  A conflicted path cannot be committed with 'svn commit' until it
  has been marked as resolved with 'svn resolve'.
  Subversion knows three types of conflicts:
  Text conflicts, Property conflicts, and Tree conflicts.
  Text conflicts occur when overlapping changes to file contents were
  made. Text conflicts are usually resolved by editing the conflicted
  file or by using a merge tool (which may be an external program).
  'svn resolve' provides options which can be used to automatically
  edit files (such as 'mine-full' or 'theirs-conflict'), but these are
  only useful in situations where it is acceptable to discard local or
  incoming changes altogether.
  Property conflicts are usually resolved by editing the value of the
  conflicted property (either from the interactive prompt, or with
  'svn propedit'). As with text conflicts, options exist to edit a
  property automatically, discarding some changes in favour of others.
  Tree conflicts occur when a change to the directory structure was
  made, and when this change cannot be applied to the working copy
  without affecting other changes (text changes, property changes,
  or other changes to the directory structure). Brief information about
  tree conflicts is shown by the 'svn status' and 'svn info' commands.
  In interactive mode, 'svn resolve' will attempt to describe tree conflicts
  in detail, and may offer options to resolve the conflict automatically.
  It is recommended to use these automatic options whenever possible,
  rather than attempting manual tree conflict resolution.
  If a tree conflict cannot be resolved automatically, it is recommended
  to figure out why the conflict occurred before attempting to resolve it.
  The 'svn log -v' command can be used to inspect structural changes
  made in past revisions, and perhaps even on other branches.
  'svn help log' describes how these structural changes are presented.
  Once the conflicting "incoming" change has been identified with 'svn log'
  the current "local" working copy state should be examined and adjusted
  in a way such that the conflict is resolved. This may involve editing
  files manually or with 'svn merge'. It may be necessary to discard some
  local changes with 'svn revert'. Files or directories might have to be
  copied, deleted, or moved.
specify automatic conflict resolution source
                             ('base', 'working', 'mine-conflict',
                             'theirs-conflict', 'mine-full', 'theirs-full')
resolved
Remove 'conflicted' state on working copy files or directories.
usage: resolved PATH...
  Note:  this subcommand does not semantically resolve conflicts or
  remove conflict markers; it merely removes the conflict-related
  artifact files and allows PATH to be committed again.  It has been
  deprecated in favor of running 'svn resolve --accept working'.
revert
Restore pristine working copy state (undo local changes).
usage: revert PATH...
  Revert changes in the working copy at or within PATH, and remove
  conflict markers as well, if any.
  This subcommand does not revert already committed changes.
  For information about undoing already committed changes, search
  the output of 'svn help merge' for 'undo'.
stat
Print the status of working copy files and directories.
usage: status [PATH...]
  With no args, print only locally modified items (no network access).
  With -q, print only summary information about locally modified items.
  With -u, add working revision and server out-of-date information.
  With -v, print full revision information on every item.
  The first seven columns in the output are each one character wide:
    First column: Says if item was added, deleted, or otherwise changed
      ' ' no modifications
      'A' Added
      'C' Conflicted
      'D' Deleted
      'I' Ignored
      'M' Modified
      'R' Replaced
      'X' an unversioned directory created by an externals definition
      '?' item is not under version control
      '!' item is missing (removed by non-svn command) or incomplete
      '~' versioned item obstructed by some item of a different kind
    Second column: Modifications of a file's or directory's properties
      ' ' no modifications
      'C' Conflicted
      'M' Modified
    Third column: Whether the working copy is locked for writing by
                  another Subversion client modifying the working copy
      ' ' not locked for writing
      'L' locked for writing
    Fourth column: Scheduled commit will create a copy (addition-with-history)
      ' ' no history scheduled with commit (item was newly added)
      '+' history scheduled with commit (item was copied)
    Fifth column: Whether the item is switched or a file external
      ' ' normal
      'S' the item has a Switched URL relative to the parent
      'X' a versioned file created by an eXternals definition
    Sixth column: Whether the item is locked in repository for exclusive commit
      (without -u)
      ' ' not locked by this working copy
      'K' locked by this working copy, but lock might be stolen or broken
      (with -u)
      ' ' not locked in repository, not locked by this working copy
      'K' locked in repository, lock owned by this working copy
      'O' locked in repository, lock owned by another working copy
      'T' locked in repository, lock owned by this working copy was stolen
      'B' not locked in repository, lock owned by this working copy is broken
    Seventh column: Whether the item is the victim of a tree conflict
      ' ' normal
      'C' tree-Conflicted
    If the item is a tree conflict victim, an additional line is printed
    after the item's status line, explaining the nature of the conflict.
  The out-of-date information appears in the ninth column (with -u):
      '*' a newer revision exists on the server
      ' ' the working copy is up to date
  Remaining fields are variable width and delimited by spaces:
    The working revision (with -u or -v; '-' if the item is copied)
    The last committed revision and last committed author (with -v)
    The working copy path is always the final field, so it can
      include spaces.
  The presence of a question mark ('?') where a working revision, last
  committed revision, or last committed author was expected indicates
  that the information is unknown or irrelevant given the state of the
  item (for example, when the item is the result of a copy operation).
  The question mark serves as a visual placeholder to facilitate parsing.
  Example output:
    svn status wc
     M      wc/bar.c
    A  +    wc/qax.c
    svn status -u wc
     M             965   wc/bar.c
            *      965   wc/foo.c
    A  +             -   wc/qax.c
    Status against revision:   981
    svn status --show-updates --verbose wc
     M             965      938 kfogel       wc/bar.c
            *      965      922 sussman      wc/foo.c
    A  +             -      687 joe          wc/qax.c
                   965      687 joe          wc/zig.c
    Status against revision:   981
    svn status
     M      wc/bar.c

          >   local missing, incoming edit upon update
    D       wc/qax.c
don't print unversioned items
switch
Update the working copy to a different URL within the same repository.
usage: 1. switch URL[@PEGREV] [PATH]
       2. switch --relocate FROM-PREFIX TO-PREFIX [PATH...]
  1. Update the working copy to mirror a new URL within the repository.
     This behavior is similar to 'svn update', and is the way to
     move a working copy to a branch or tag within the same repository.
     If specified, PEGREV determines in which revision the target is first
     looked up.
     If --force is used, unversioned obstructing paths in the working
     copy do not automatically cause a failure if the switch attempts to
     add the same path.  If the obstructing path is the same type (file
     or directory) as the corresponding path in the repository it becomes
     versioned but its contents are left 'as-is' in the working copy.
     This means that an obstructing directory's unversioned children may
     also obstruct and become versioned.  For files, any content differences
     between the obstruction and the repository are treated like a local
     modification to the working copy.  All properties from the repository
     are applied to the obstructing path.
     Use the --set-depth option to set a new working copy depth on the
     targets of this operation.
     By default, Subversion will refuse to switch a working copy path to
     a new URL with which it shares no common version control ancestry.
     Use the '--ignore-ancestry' option to override this sanity check.
  2. The '--relocate' option is deprecated. This syntax is equivalent to
     'svn relocate FROM-PREFIX TO-PREFIX [PATH]'.
  See also 'svn help update' for a list of possible characters
  reporting the action taken.
  Examples:
    svn switch ^/branches/1.x-release
    svn switch --relocate http:// svn://
    svn switch --relocate http://www.example.com/repo/project \
                          svn://svn.example.com/repo/project
allow switching to a node with no common ancestor
handle unversioned obstructions as changes
deprecated; use 'svn relocate'
unlock
Unlock working copy paths or URLs.
usage: unlock TARGET...
  Use --force to break a lock held by another user or working copy.
break locks
update
Bring changes from the repository into the working copy.
usage: update [PATH...]
  If no revision is given, bring working copy up-to-date with HEAD rev.
  Else synchronize working copy to revision given by -r.
  For each updated item a line will be printed with characters reporting
  the action taken. These characters have the following meaning:
    A  Added
    D  Deleted
    U  Updated
    C  Conflict
    G  Merged
    E  Existed
    R  Replaced
  Characters in the first column report about the item itself.
  Characters in the second column report about properties of the item.
  A 'B' in the third column signifies that the lock for the file has
  been broken or stolen.
  A 'C' in the fourth column indicates a tree conflict, while a 'C' in
  the first and second columns indicate textual conflicts in files
  and in property values, respectively.
  If --force is used, unversioned obstructing paths in the working
  copy do not automatically cause a failure if the update attempts to
  add the same path.  If the obstructing path is the same type (file
  or directory) as the corresponding path in the repository it becomes
  versioned but its contents are left 'as-is' in the working copy.
  This means that an obstructing directory's unversioned children may
  also obstruct and become versioned.  For files, any content differences
  between the obstruction and the repository are treated like a local
  modification to the working copy.  All properties from the repository
  are applied to the obstructing path.  Obstructing paths are reported
  in the first column with code 'E'.
  If the specified update target is missing from the working copy but its
  immediate parent directory is present, checkout the target into its
  parent directory at the specified depth.  If --parents is specified,
  create any missing parent directories of the target by checking them
  out, too, at depth=empty.
  Use the --set-depth option to set a new working copy depth on the
  targets of this operation.
upgrade
Upgrade the metadata storage format for a working copy.
usage: upgrade [WCPATH...]
  Local modifications are preserved.
x-shelve
shelve
Put a local change aside, as if putting it on a shelf.
usage: 1. x-shelve [--keep-local] NAME [PATH...]
       2. x-shelve --delete NAME
       3. x-shelve --list
  1. Save the local change in the given PATHs to a patch file, and
     revert that change from the WC unless '--keep-local' is given.
     If a log message is given with '-m' or '-F', include it at the
     beginning of the patch file.
  2. Delete the shelved change NAME.
     (A backup is kept, named with a '.bak' extension.)
  3. List shelved changes. Include the first line of any log message
     and some details about the contents of the change, unless '-q' is
     given.
  The kinds of change you can shelve are those supported by 'svn diff'
  and 'svn patch'. The following are currently NOT supported:
     mergeinfo changes, copies, moves, mkdir, rmdir,
     'binary' content, uncommittable states
  To bring back a shelved change, use 'svn x-unshelve NAME'.
  Shelved changes are stored in <WC>/.svn/shelves/
  The shelving feature is EXPERIMENTAL. This command is likely to change
  in the next release, and there is no promise of backward compatibility.
x-unshelve
unshelve
Bring a shelved change back to a local change in the WC.
usage: 1. x-unshelve [--keep-shelved] [NAME]
       2. x-unshelve --list
  1. Apply the shelved change NAME to the working copy.
     Delete the patch unless the '--keep-shelved' option is given.
     (A backup is kept, named with a '.bak' extension.)
     NAME defaults to the most recent shelved change.
  2. List shelved changes. Include the first line of any log message
     and some details about the contents of the change, unless '-q' is
     given.
  Any conflict between the change being unshelved and a change
  already in the WC is handled the same way as by 'svn patch',
  creating a 'reject' file.
  The shelving feature is EXPERIMENTAL. This command is likely to change
  in the next release, and there is no promise of backward compatibility.
x-shelves
shelves
List shelved changes.
usage: x-shelves
  The shelving feature is EXPERIMENTAL. This command is likely to change
  in the next release, and there is no promise of backward compatibility.
