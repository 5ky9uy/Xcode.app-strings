fsfs
%s repositories are not supported
general usage: svnfsfs SUBCOMMAND REPOS_PATH  [ARGS & OPTIONS ...]
Subversion FSFS repository manipulation tool.
Type 'svnfsfs help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.
Type 'svnfsfs --version' to see the program version.
Available subcommands:
svnfsfs
svnfsfs: 
help
usage: svnfsfs help [SUBCOMMAND...]
Describe the usage of this program or its subcommands.
dump-index
usage: svnfsfs dump-index REPOS_PATH -r REV
Dump the index contents for the revision / pack file containing revision REV
to console.  This is only available for FSFS format 7 (SVN 1.9+) repositories.
The table produced contains a header in the first line followed by one line
per index entry, ordered by location in the revision / pack file.  Columns:
   * Byte offset (hex) at which the item starts
   * Length (hex) of the item in bytes
   * Item type (string) is one of the following:
        none ... Unused section.  File contents shall be NULs.
        frep ... File representation.
        drep ... Directory representation.
        fprop .. File property.
        dprop .. Directory property.
        node ... Node revision.
        chgs ... Changed paths list.
        rep .... Representation of unknown type.  Should not be used.
        ??? .... Invalid.  Index data is corrupt.
        The distinction between frep, drep, fprop and dprop is a mere internal
        classification used for various optimizations and does not affect the
        operational correctness.
   * Revision that the item belongs to (decimal)
   * Item number (decimal) within that revision
   * Modified FNV1a checksum (8 hex digits)
load-index
usage: svnfsfs load-index REPOS_PATH
Read index contents from console.  The format is the same as produced by the
dump-index command, except that checksum as well as header are optional and will
be ignored.  The data must cover the full revision / pack file;  the revision
number is automatically extracted from input stream.  No ordering is required.
stats
usage: svnfsfs stats REPOS_PATH
Write object size statistics to console.
