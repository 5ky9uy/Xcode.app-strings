general usage: svnsync SUBCOMMAND DEST_URL  [ARGS & OPTIONS ...]
Subversion repository replication tool.
Type 'svnsync help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.
Type 'svnsync --version' to see the program version and RA modules.
Available subcommands:
The following repository access (RA) modules are available:
quiet
print as little as possible
revision
operate on revision ARG (or range ARG1:ARG2)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                 NUMBER       revision number
                                 'HEAD'       latest in repository
allow-non-empty
allow a non-empty destination repository
non-interactive
do no interactive prompting (default is to prompt
                             only if standard input is a terminal device)
force-interactive
do interactive prompting even if standard input
                             is not a terminal device
no-auth-cache
do not cache authentication tokens
username
specify a username ARG (deprecated;
                             see --source-username and --sync-username)
password
specify a password ARG (deprecated;
                             see --source-password and --sync-password)
trust-server-cert
deprecated; same as
                             --source-trust-server-cert-failures=unknown-ca
                             --sync-trust-server-cert-failures=unknown-ca
source-trust-server-cert-failures
with --non-interactive, accept SSL
                             server certificates with failures.
                             ARG is a comma-separated list of:
                             - 'unknown-ca' (Unknown Authority)
                             - 'cn-mismatch' (Hostname mismatch)
                             - 'expired' (Expired certificate)
                             - 'not-yet-valid' (Not yet valid certificate)
                             - 'other' (all other not separately classified
                               certificate errors).
                             Applied to the source URL.
sync-trust-server-cert-failures
Like
                             --source-trust-server-cert-failures,
                             but applied to the destination URL.
source-username
connect to source repository with username ARG
source-password
connect to source repository with password ARG
sync-username
connect to sync repository with username ARG
sync-password
connect to sync repository with password ARG
config-dir
read user configuration files from directory ARG
config-option
set user configuration option in the format:
                                 FILE:SECTION:OPTION=[VALUE]
                             For example:
                                 servers:global:http-library=serf
source-prop-encoding
convert translatable properties from encoding ARG
                             to UTF-8. If not specified, then properties are
                             presumed to be encoded in UTF-8.
disable-locking
Disable built-in locking.  Use of this option can
                             corrupt the mirror unless you ensure that no other
                             instance of svnsync is running concurrently.
steal-lock
Steal locks as necessary.  Use, with caution,
                             if your mirror repository contains stale locks
                             and is not being concurrently accessed by another
                             svnsync instance.
memory-cache-size
size of the extra in-memory cache in MB used to
                             minimize operations for local 'file' scheme.
version
show program version information
show help on a subcommand
initialize
init
usage: svnsync initialize DEST_URL SOURCE_URL
Initialize a destination repository for synchronization from
another repository.
If the source URL is not the root of a repository, only the
specified part of the repository will be synchronized.
The destination URL must point to the root of a repository which
has been configured to allow revision property changes.  In
the general case, the destination repository must contain no
committed revisions.  Use --allow-non-empty to override this
restriction, which will cause svnsync to assume that any revisions
already present in the destination repository perfectly mirror
their counterparts in the source repository.  (This is useful
when initializing a copy of a repository as a mirror of that same
repository, for example.)
You should not commit to, or make revision property changes in,
the destination repository by any method other than 'svnsync'.
In other words, the destination repository should be a read-only
mirror of the source repository.
synchronize
sync
usage: svnsync synchronize DEST_URL [SOURCE_URL]
Transfer all pending revisions to the destination from the source
with which it was initialized.
If SOURCE_URL is provided, use that as the source repository URL,
ignoring what is recorded in the destination repository as the
source URL.  Specifying SOURCE_URL is recommended in particular
if untrusted users/administrators may have write access to the
DEST_URL repository.
copy-revprops
usage:
    1. svnsync copy-revprops DEST_URL [SOURCE_URL]
    2. svnsync copy-revprops DEST_URL REV[:REV2]
Copy the revision properties in a given range of revisions to the
destination from the source with which it was initialized.  If the
revision range is not specified, it defaults to all revisions in
the DEST_URL repository.  Note also that the 'HEAD' revision is the
latest in DEST_URL, not necessarily the latest in SOURCE_URL.
If SOURCE_URL is provided, use that as the source repository URL,
ignoring what is recorded in the destination repository as the
source URL.  Specifying SOURCE_URL is recommended in particular
if untrusted users/administrators may have write access to the
DEST_URL repository.
Form 2 is deprecated syntax, equivalent to specifying "-rREV[:REV2]".
info
usage: svnsync info DEST_URL
Print information about the synchronization destination repository
located at DEST_URL.
usage: svnsync help [SUBCOMMAND...]
Describe the usage of this program or its subcommands.
Path '%s' is not a URL
Session is rooted at '%s' but the repos root is '%s'
Destination repository already contains revision history; consider using --allow-non-empty if the repository's revisions are known to mirror their respective revisions in the source repository
svn:sync-from-url
Destination repository is already synchronizing from '%s'
partial-replay
Destination repository has more revisions than source repository
svn:sync-from-uuid
svn:sync-last-merged-rev
svn:sync-
Copied properties for revision %ld (%s* properties skipped).
Copied properties for revision %ld.
NOTE: Normalized %s* properties to LF line endings (%d rev-props, %d node-props).
svn:
svn:sync-lock
atomic-revprops
Target server does not support atomic revision property edits; consider upgrading it to 1.7 or using an external locking program
Stole lock previously held by '%s'
Failed to get lock on destination repos, currently held by '%s'
svn:sync-currently-copying
Revision being currently copied (%ld), last merged revision (%ld), and destination HEAD (%ld) are inconsistent; have you committed to the destination without using svnsync?
Destination HEAD (%ld) is not the last merged revision (%ld); have you committed to the destination without using svnsync?
commit-revprops
Destination repository has not been initialized
svn:log
svn:author
svn:date
Committed revision %ld.
Commit created r%ld but should have created r%ld
Cannot specify revisions via both command-line arguments and the --revision (-r) option

Repository '%s' is not initialized for synchronization
