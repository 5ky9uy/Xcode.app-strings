Usage: [-do dataForkOffset] -d dataForkName [-ro resForkOffset] -r resForkName -o outFileName [-f]
     : dataForkOffset defines how far into dataForkName file the data fork starts
     :  resForkOffset defines how far into  resForkName file the resource fork starts
     :  -f specifies delete output file if it already exists

Don't know what to do with option '%s'
Option missing, starting with '%s'
Must have 3 files to wack - data file, resource file, output file
I'm not gonna overwrite '%s' for your safety.
Data fork '%s' doesn't exist.
Resource fork '%s' doesn't exist.
Can't create '%s' - errno = %d
Created output file %s
Can't open '%s' - errno = %d
opened resource file %s
Checked %s and it looks like it's not a resource fork.
%s is in Ethershare format (offset 512).
problems catenating dataFile
Data fork is %d bytes
problems catenating resFile
Resource fork is %d bytes

Usage: [-do dataForkOffset] -d dataForkName [-ro resForkOffset] -r resForkName -o outFileName
     :  resForkOffset defines how far into  resForkName file the data fork starts
