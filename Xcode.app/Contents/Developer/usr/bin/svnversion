Type 'svnversion --help' for usage.
usage: svnversion [OPTIONS] [WC_PATH [TRAIL_URL]]
Subversion working copy identification tool.
Type 'svnversion --version' to see the program version.
  Produce a compact version identifier for the working copy path
  WC_PATH.  TRAIL_URL is the trailing portion of the URL used to
  determine if WC_PATH itself is switched (detection of switches
  within WC_PATH does not rely on TRAIL_URL).  The version identifier
  is written to standard output.  For example:
    $ svnversion . /repos/svn/trunk
    4168
  The version identifier will be a single number if the working
  copy is single revision, unmodified, not switched and with
  a URL that matches the TRAIL_URL argument.  If the working
  copy is unusual the version identifier will be more complex:
   4123:4168     mixed revision working copy
   4168M         modified working copy
   4123S         switched working copy
   4123P         partial working copy, from a sparse checkout
   4123:4168MS   mixed revision, modified, switched working copy
  If WC_PATH is an unversioned path, the program will output
  'Unversioned directory' or 'Unversioned file'.  If WC_PATH is
  an added or copied or moved path, the program will output
  'Uncommitted local addition, copy or move'.
  If invoked without arguments WC_PATH will be the current directory.
Valid options:
  %s
