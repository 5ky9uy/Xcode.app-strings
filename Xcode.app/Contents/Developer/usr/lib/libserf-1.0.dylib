Initialized Kerberos context for this connection.
Set Negotiate authn header on retried request.
Assume for now that the server supports persistent SPNEGO authentication.
SPNEGO on this connection is persistent, don't set authn header on next request.
Add initial Negotiate header to request.
Validate Negotiate response header.
SPNEGO handshake completed.
Server requires per-request SPNEGO authn, switching to stateless mode.
