After fixing the error cause you may try to fix up
the remote tracking information by invoking
"git branch --set-upstream-to=%s%s%s".
the requested upstream branch '%s' does not exist
If you are planning on basing your work on an upstream
branch that already exists at the remote, you may need to
run "git fetch" to retrieve it.
If you are planning to push out a new local branch that
will track its remote counterpart, you may want to use
"git push -u" to set the upstream config as you push.
Cannot setup tracking information; starting point '%s' is not a branch.

s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
d, drop <commit> = remove commit
l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
.       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
.       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
.       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
Do not remove any line. Use 'drop' explicitly to remove a commit.
If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
You are editing the todo file of an ongoing interactive rebase.
To continue rebase after editing, run:
    git rebase --continue
However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
Note that empty commits are commented out

The destination you provided is not a full refname (i.e.,
starting with "refs/"). We tried to guess what you meant by:
- Looking for a ref that matches '%s' on the remote side.
- Checking if the <src> being pushed ('%s')
  is a ref in "refs/{heads,tags}/". If so we add a corresponding
  refs/{heads,tags}/ prefix on the remote side.
Neither worked, so we gave up. You must fully qualify the ref.
'%s' is not a valid object, match_explicit_lhs() should catch this!
The <src> part of the refspec is a commit object.
Did you mean to create a new branch by pushing to
'%s:refs/heads/%s'?
The <src> part of the refspec is a tag object.
Did you mean to create a new tag by pushing to
'%s:refs/tags/%s'?
The <src> part of the refspec is a tree object.
Did you mean to tag a new tree by pushing to
'%s:refs/tags/%s'?
The <src> part of the refspec is a blob object.
Did you mean to tag a new blob by pushing to
'%s:refs/tags/%s'?

refname '%.*s' is ambiguous.
Git normally never creates a ref that ends with 40 hex characters
because it will be ignored when you just specify 40-hex. These refs
may be created by mistake. For example,
  git checkout -b $br $(git rev-parse ...)
where "$br" is somehow empty and a 40-hex ref is created. Please
examine these refs and maybe delete them. Turn this message off by
running "git config advice.objectNameWarning false"
