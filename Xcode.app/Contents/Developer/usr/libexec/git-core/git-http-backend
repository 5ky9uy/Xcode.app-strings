Cherry-picking is not possible because you have unmerged files.

Merging is not possible because you have unmerged files.

Pulling is not possible because you have unmerged files.
revert
Reverting is not possible because you have unmerged files.
It is not possible to %s because you have unmerged files.
Fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>'

Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.
You have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists).
Please, commit your changes before merging.
Exiting because of unfinished merge.
Note: checking out '%s'.
You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:
  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

Git normally never creates a ref that ends with 40 hex characters
because it will be ignored when you just specify 40-hex. These refs
may be created by mistake. For example,
  git checkout -b $br $(git rev-parse ...)
where "$br" is somehow empty and a 40-hex ref is created. Please
examine these refs and maybe delete them. Turn this message off by
running "git config advice.objectNameWarning false"
