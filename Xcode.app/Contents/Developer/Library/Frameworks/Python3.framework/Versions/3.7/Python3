time.struct_time
The time value as returned by gmtime(), localtime(), and strptime(), and
 accepted by asctime(), mktime() and strftime().  May be considered as a
 sequence of 9 integers.
 Note that several fields' values are not the same as those defined by
 the C language standard for struct tm.  For example, the value of the
 field tm_year is the actual year, not year - 1900.  See individual
 fields' descriptions for details.
tm_year
year, for example, 1993
tm_mon
month of year, range [1, 12]
tm_mday
day of month, range [1, 31]
tm_hour

Core implementation of import.
This module is NOT meant to be directly imported! It has been designed such
that it can be bootstrapped into Python as the implementation of import. As
such it requires the injection of specific modules and attributes in order to
work. One should use importlib as the public-facing version of this module.

ModuleSpeca
The specification for a module, used for loading.
    A module's spec is the source for information about the module.  For
    data associated with the module, including source, use the spec's
    loader.
    `name` is the absolute name of the module.  `loader` is the loader
    to use when loading the module.  `parent` is the name of the
    package the module is in.  The parent is derived from the name.
    `is_package` determines if the module is considered a package or
    not.  On modules this is reflected by the `__path__` attribute.
    `origin` is the specific location used by the loader from which to
    load the module, if that information is available.  When filename is
    set, origin will match.
    `has_location` indicates that a spec's "origin" reflects a location.
    When this is True, `__file__` attribute of the module is set.
    `cached` is the location of the cached bytecode file, if any.  It
    corresponds to the `__cached__` attribute.
    `submodule_search_locations` is the sequence of path entries to
    search when importing submodules.  If set, is_package should be
    True--and False otherwise.
    Packages are simply modules that (may) have submodules.  If a spec
    has a non-None value in `submodule_search_locations`, the import
    system will consider modules loaded from the spec as packages.
    Only finders (see importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder and
    importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder) should modify ModuleSpec instances.

    being imported (e.g. ``from module import <fromlist>``).  The 'level'
    argument represents the package location to import from in a relative

Core implementation of path-based import.
This module is NOT meant to be directly imported! It has been designed such
that it can be bootstrapped into Python as the implementation of import. As
such it requires the injection of specific modules and attributes in order to
work. One should use importlib as the public-facing version of this module.

classmethod(function) -> method
Convert a function to be a class method.
A class method receives the class as implicit first argument,
just like an instance method receives the instance.
To declare a class method, use this idiom:
  class C:
      @classmethod
      def f(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):
          ...
It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance
(e.g. C().f()).  The instance is ignored except for its class.
If a class method is called for a derived class, the derived class
object is passed as the implied first argument.
Class methods are different than C++ or Java static methods.
If you want those, see the staticmethod builtin.
staticmethod(function) -> method
Convert a function to be a static method.
A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.
To declare a static method, use this idiom:
     class C:
         @staticmethod
         def f(arg1, arg2, ...):
             ...
It can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance
(e.g. C().f()).  The instance is ignored except for its class.
Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++.
For a more advanced concept, see the classmethod builtin.

int(x, base=10) -> integer
Convert a number or string to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments
are given.  If x is a number, return x.__int__().  For floating point
numbers, this truncates towards zero.
If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string,

    the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array.  If
    byteorder is 'little', the most significant byte is at the end of the
    byte array.  To request the native byte order of the host system, use
    `sys.byteorder' as the byte order value.

Return state information for pickling
Capsule objects let you wrap a C "void *" pointer in a Python
object.  They're a way of passing data through the Python interpreter
without creating your own custom type.
Capsules are used for communication between extension modules.
They provide a way for an extension module to export a C interface
to other extension modules, so that extension modules can use the
Python import mechanism to link to one another.

Internal helper function used by the class statement.
__import__(name, globals=None, locals=None, fromlist=(), level=0) -> module
Import a module. Because this function is meant for use by the Python
interpreter and not for general use, it is better to use
importlib.import_module() to programmatically import a module.
The globals argument is only used to determine the context;
they are not modified.  The locals argument is unused.  The fromlist
should be a list of names to emulate ``from name import ...'', or an
empty list to emulate ``import name''.
When importing a module from a package, note that __import__('A.B', ...)
returns package A when fromlist is empty, but its submodule B when
fromlist is not empty.  The level argument is used to determine whether to
perform absolute or relative imports: 0 is absolute, while a positive number

__call__() method.
chr($module, i, /)

The source code may represent a Python module, statement or expression.
The filename will be used for run-time error messages.
The mode must be 'exec' to compile a module, 'single' to compile a
single (interactive) statement, or 'eval' to compile an expression.
The flags argument, if present, controls which future statements influence
the compilation of the code.

the effects of any future statements in effect in the code calling
compile; if absent or false these statements do influence the compilation,
in addition to any features explicitly specified.

of the given object, and of attributes reachable from it.
If the object supplies a method named __dir__, it will be used; otherwise
the default dir() logic is used and returns:
  for a module object: the module's attributes.
  for a class object:  its attributes, and recursively the attributes
    of its bases.
  for any other object: its attributes, its class's attributes, and
    recursively the attributes of its class's base classes.

covered by any backwards compatibility guarantees.
max(iterable, *[, default=obj, key=func]) -> value
max(arg1, arg2, *args, *[, key=func]) -> value
With a single iterable argument, return its biggest item. The
default keyword-only argument specifies an object to return if
the provided iterable is empty.
With two or more arguments, return the largest argument.
min(iterable, *[, default=obj, key=func]) -> value
min(arg1, arg2, *args, *[, key=func]) -> value

This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in
a binary format. The format is specific to Python, but independent of
machine architecture issues.
Not all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects
whose value is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be
written and read by this module. The following types are supported:
None, integers, floating point numbers, strings, bytes, bytearrays,
tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries, and code objects, where it
should be understood that tuples, lists and dictionaries are only
supported as long as the values contained therein are themselves
supported; and recursive lists and dictionaries should not be written
(they will cause infinite loops).
Variables:
version -- indicates the format that the module uses. Version 0 is the
    historical format, version 1 shares interned strings and version 2
    uses a binary format for floating point numbers.
    Version 3 shares common object references (New in version 3.4).
Functions:
dump() -- write value to a file
load() -- read value from a file
dumps() -- marshal value as a bytes object
loads() -- read value from a bytes-like object
dump($module, value, file, version=version, /)
Write the value on the open file.
  value
    Must be a supported type.
  file
    Must be a writeable binary file.
  version
    Indicates the data format that dump should use.
If the value has (or contains an object that has) an unsupported type, a
ValueError exception is raised - but garbage data will also be written
to the file. The object will not be properly read back by load().
load($module, file, /)
Read one value from the open file and return it.
  file
    Must be readable binary file.
If no valid value is read (e.g. because the data has a different Python
version's incompatible marshal format), raise EOFError, ValueError or
TypeError.
Note: If an object containing an unsupported type was marshalled with
dump(), load() will substitute None for the unmarshallable type.
dumps($module, value, version=version, /)
Return the bytes object that would be written to a file by dump(value, file).
  value
    Must be a supported type.
  version
    Indicates the data format that dumps should use.
Raise a ValueError exception if value has (or contains an object that has) an
unsupported type.
loads($module, bytes, /)
Convert the bytes-like object to a value.
If no valid value is found, raise EOFError, ValueError or TypeError.  Extra
bytes in the input are ignored.

This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the
interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
Dynamic objects:
argv -- command line arguments; argv[0] is the script pathname if known
path -- module search path; path[0] is the script directory, else ''
modules -- dictionary of loaded modules
displayhook -- called to show results in an interactive session
excepthook -- called to handle any uncaught exception other than SystemExit
  To customize printing in an interactive session or to install a custom
  top-level exception handler, assign other functions to replace these.
stdin -- standard input file object; used by input()
stdout -- standard output file object; used by print()
stderr -- standard error object; used for error messages
  By assigning other file objects (or objects that behave like files)
  to these, it is possible to redirect all of the interpreter's I/O.
last_type -- type of last uncaught exception
last_value -- value of last uncaught exception
last_traceback -- traceback of last uncaught exception
  These three are only available in an interactive session after a
  traceback has been printed.
Static objects:
builtin_module_names -- tuple of module names built into this interpreter
copyright -- copyright notice pertaining to this interpreter
exec_prefix -- prefix used to find the machine-specific Python library
executable -- absolute path of the executable binary of the Python interpreter
float_info -- a struct sequence with information about the float implementation.
float_repr_style -- string indicating the style of repr() output for floats
hash_info -- a struct sequence with information about the hash algorithm.
hexversion -- version information encoded as a single integer
implementation -- Python implementation information.
int_info -- a struct sequence with information about the int implementation.
maxsize -- the largest supported length of containers.
maxunicode -- the value of the largest Unicode code point
platform -- platform identifier
prefix -- prefix used to find the Python library
thread_info -- a struct sequence with information about the thread implementation.
version -- the version of this interpreter as a string
version_info -- version information as a named tuple

breakpointhook(*args, **kws)
This hook function is called by built-in breakpoint().
callstats() -> tuple of integers
Return a tuple of function call statistics, if CALL_PROFILE was defined
when Python was built.  Otherwise, return None.
When enabled, this function returns detailed, implementation-specific
details about the number of function calls executed. The return value is
a 11-tuple where the entries in the tuple are counts of:
0. all function calls
1. calls to PyFunction_Type objects
2. PyFunction calls that do not create an argument tuple
3. PyFunction calls that do not create an argument tuple
   and bypass PyEval_EvalCodeEx()
4. PyMethod calls
5. PyMethod calls on bound methods
6. PyType calls
7. PyCFunction calls
8. generator calls
9. All other calls
10. Number of stack pops performed by call_function()
_clear_type_cache() -> None
Clear the internal type lookup cache.
_current_frames() -> dictionary
Return a dictionary mapping each current thread T's thread id to T's
current stack frame.
This function should be used for specialized purposes only.
displayhook(object) -> None
Print an object to sys.stdout and also save it in builtins._
exc_info() -> (type, value, traceback)
Return information about the most recent exception caught by an except
clause in the current stack frame or in an older stack frame.
excepthook(exctype, value, traceback) -> None
Handle an exception by displaying it with a traceback on sys.stderr.
exit([status])
Exit the interpreter by raising SystemExit(status).
If the status is omitted or None, it defaults to zero (i.e., success).
If the status is an integer, it will be used as the system exit status.
If it is another kind of object, it will be printed and the system
exit status will be one (i.e., failure).
getdefaultencoding() -> string
Return the current default string encoding used by the Unicode 
implementation.
getdlopenflags() -> int
Return the current value of the flags that are used for dlopen calls.
The flag constants are defined in the os module.

Return the encoding used to convert Unicode filenames in
operating system filenames.
getfilesystemencodeerrors() -> string
Return the error mode used to convert Unicode filenames in
operating system filenames.
getrefcount(object) -> integer
Return the reference count of object.  The count returned is generally
one higher than you might expect, because it includes the (temporary)
reference as an argument to getrefcount().
getrecursionlimit()
Return the current value of the recursion limit, the maximum depth
of the Python interpreter stack.  This limit prevents infinite
recursion from causing an overflow of the C stack and crashing Python.
getsizeof(object, default) -> int
Return the size of object in bytes.
_getframe([depth]) -> frameobject
Return a frame object from the call stack.  If optional integer depth is
given, return the frame object that many calls below the top of the stack.
If that is deeper than the call stack, ValueError is raised.  The default
for depth is zero, returning the frame at the top of the call stack.
This function should be used for internal and specialized
purposes only.
intern(string) -> string
``Intern'' the given string.  This enters the string in the (global)
table of interned strings whose purpose is to speed up dictionary lookups.
Return the string itself or the previously interned string object with the
same value.
is_finalizing()
Return True if Python is exiting.
setcheckinterval(n)
Tell the Python interpreter to check for asynchronous events every
n instructions.  This also affects how often thread switches occur.
getcheckinterval() -> current check interval; see setcheckinterval().
setswitchinterval(n)
Set the ideal thread switching delay inside the Python interpreter
The actual frequency of switching threads can be lower if the
interpreter executes long sequences of uninterruptible code
(this is implementation-specific and workload-dependent).
The parameter must represent the desired switching delay in seconds
A typical value is 0.005 (5 milliseconds).
getswitchinterval() -> current thread switch interval; see setswitchinterval().
setdlopenflags(n) -> None
Set the flags used by the interpreter for dlopen calls, such as when the
interpreter loads extension modules.  Among other things, this will enable
a lazy resolving of symbols when importing a module, if called as
sys.setdlopenflags(0).  To share symbols across extension modules, call as
sys.setdlopenflags(os.RTLD_GLOBAL).  Symbolic names for the flag modules
can be found in the os module (RTLD_xxx constants, e.g. os.RTLD_LAZY).
setprofile(function)
Set the profiling function.  It will be called on each function call
and return.  See the profiler chapter in the library manual.
getprofile()
Return the profiling function set with sys.setprofile.
See the profiler chapter in the library manual.
setrecursionlimit(n)
Set the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to n.  This
limit prevents infinite recursion from causing an overflow of the C
stack and crashing Python.  The highest possible limit is platform-
dependent.
settrace(function)
Set the global debug tracing function.  It will be called on each
function call.  See the debugger chapter in the library manual.
gettrace()
Return the global debug tracing function set with sys.settrace.
See the debugger chapter in the library manual.
call_tracing(func, args) -> object
Call func(*args), while tracing is enabled.  The tracing state is
saved, and restored afterwards.  This is intended to be called from
a debugger from a checkpoint, to recursively debug some other code.
_debugmallocstats()
Print summary info to stderr about the state of
pymalloc's structures.
In Py_DEBUG mode, also perform some expensive internal consistency
checks.
set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth($module, /, depth)

Coroutine objects will track 'depth' frames of traceback information about
where they came from, available in their cr_origin attribute. Set depth of 0
to disable.

set_asyncgen_hooks(*, firstiter=None, finalizer=None)
Set a finalizer for async generators objects.
get_asyncgen_hooks()
Return a namedtuple of installed asynchronous generators hooks (firstiter, finalizer).

disguised Unix interface).  Refer to the library manual and
corresponding Unix manual entries for more information on calls.
stat($module, /, path, *, dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)
Perform a stat system call on the given path.
  path
    Path to be examined; can be string, bytes, a path-like object or
    open-file-descriptor int.
  dir_fd
    If not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
    and path should be a relative string; path will then be relative to
    that directory.
  follow_symlinks
    If False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic link,
    stat will examine the symbolic link itself instead of the file
    the link points to.
dir_fd and follow_symlinks may not be implemented
  on your platform.  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a
  NotImplementedError.
It's an error to use dir_fd or follow_symlinks when specifying path as
  an open file descriptor.

  effective_ids
    If True, access will use the effective uid/gid instead of
    the real uid/gid.
  follow_symlinks
    If False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic link,
    access will examine the symbolic link itself instead of the file
    the link points to.
dir_fd, effective_ids, and follow_symlinks may not be implemented
  on your platform.  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a
  NotImplementedError.
Note that most operations will use the effective uid/gid, therefore this
  routine can be used in a suid/sgid environment to test if the invoking user
  has the specified access to the path.

    and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that
    directory.
  follow_symlinks
    If False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic link,
    chmod will modify the symbolic link itself instead of the file
    the link points to.
It is an error to use dir_fd or follow_symlinks when specifying path as
  an open file descriptor.
dir_fd and follow_symlinks may not be implemented on your platform.
  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a NotImplementedError.

If follow_symlinks is False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic
  link, chown will modify the symbolic link itself instead of the file the
  link points to.
It is an error to use dir_fd or follow_symlinks when specifying path as
  an open file descriptor.
dir_fd and follow_symlinks may not be implemented on your platform.
  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a NotImplementedError.

If follow_symlinks is False, and the last element of src is a symbolic
  link, link will create a link to the symbolic link itself instead of the
  file the link points to.

Create a symbolic link pointing to src named dst.
target_is_directory is required on Windows if the target is to be
  interpreted as a directory.  (On Windows, symlink requires
  Windows 6.0 or greater, and raises a NotImplementedError otherwise.)

If times is not None, it must be a tuple (atime, mtime);
    atime and mtime should be expressed as float seconds since the epoch.
If ns is specified, it must be a tuple (atime_ns, mtime_ns);
    atime_ns and mtime_ns should be expressed as integer nanoseconds
    since the epoch.

The default factory is called without arguments to produce
a new value when a key is not present, in __getitem__ only.
A defaultdict compares equal to a dict with the same items.
All remaining arguments are treated the same as if they were
passed to the dict constructor, including keyword arguments.
__missing__(key) # Called by __getitem__ for missing key; pseudo-code:
  if self.default_factory is None: raise KeyError((key,))
  self[key] = value = self.default_factory()

Return elements from the iterable until it is exhausted.
Then repeat the sequence indefinitely.
dropwhile(predicate, iterable) --> dropwhile object
Drop items from the iterable while predicate(item) is true.
Afterwards, return every element until the iterable is exhausted.
takewhile(predicate, iterable) --> takewhile object
Return successive entries from an iterable as long as the 
predicate evaluates to true for each entry.
islice(iterable, stop) --> islice object
islice(iterable, start, stop[, step]) --> islice object
Return an iterator whose next() method returns selected values from an
iterable.  If start is specified, will skip all preceding elements;
otherwise, start defaults to zero.  Step defaults to one.  If
specified as another value, step determines how many values are 
skipped between successive calls.  Works like a slice() on a list
but returns an iterator.
starmap(function, sequence) --> starmap object
Return an iterator whose values are returned from the function evaluated
with an argument tuple taken from the given sequence.
chain(*iterables) --> chain object
Return a chain object whose .__next__() method returns elements from the
first iterable until it is exhausted, then elements from the next
iterable, until all of the iterables are exhausted.
chain.from_iterable(iterable) --> chain object

that evaluates lazily.
compress(data, selectors) --> iterator over selected data
Return data elements corresponding to true selector elements.

            yield x
            x += step
zip_longest(iter1 [,iter2 [...]], [fillvalue=None]) --> zip_longest object
Return a zip_longest object whose .__next__() method returns a tuple where
the i-th element comes from the i-th iterable argument.  The .__next__()
method continues until the longest iterable in the argument sequence
is exhausted and then it raises StopIteration.  When the shorter iterables
are exhausted, the fillvalue is substituted in their place.  The fillvalue
defaults to None or can be specified by a keyword argument.
permutations(iterable[, r]) --> permutations object
Return successive r-length permutations of elements in the iterable.
permutations(range(3), 2) --> (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)
product(*iterables, repeat=1) --> product object
Cartesian product of input iterables.  Equivalent to nested for-loops.
For example, product(A, B) returns the same as:  ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).
The leftmost iterators are in the outermost for-loop, so the output tuples
cycle in a manner similar to an odometer (with the rightmost element changing
on every iteration).
To compute the product of an iterable with itself, specify the number
of repetitions with the optional repeat keyword argument. For example,
product(A, repeat=4) means the same as product(A, A, A, A).
product('ab', range(3)) --> ('a',0) ('a',1) ('a',2) ('b',0) ('b',1) ('b',2)
product((0,1), (0,1), (0,1)) --> (0,0,0) (0,0,1) (0,1,0) (0,1,1) (1,0,0) ...
repeat(object [,times]) -> create an iterator which returns the object
for the specified number of times.  If not specified, returns the object
endlessly.
Private method returning an estimate of len(list(it)).
groupby(iterable, key=None) -> make an iterator that returns consecutive
keys and groups from the iterable.  If the key function is not specified or
is None, the element itself is used for grouping.
Iterator wrapped to make it copyable
Returns an independent iterator.
Data container common to multiple tee objects.
Functional tools for creating and using iterators.
Infinite iterators:
count(start=0, step=1) --> start, start+step, start+2*step, ...
cycle(p) --> p0, p1, ... plast, p0, p1, ...
repeat(elem [,n]) --> elem, elem, elem, ... endlessly or up to n times
Iterators terminating on the shortest input sequence:
accumulate(p[, func]) --> p0, p0+p1, p0+p1+p2
chain(p, q, ...) --> p0, p1, ... plast, q0, q1, ... 
chain.from_iterable([p, q, ...]) --> p0, p1, ... plast, q0, q1, ... 
compress(data, selectors) --> (d[0] if s[0]), (d[1] if s[1]), ...
dropwhile(pred, seq) --> seq[n], seq[n+1], starting when pred fails
groupby(iterable[, keyfunc]) --> sub-iterators grouped by value of keyfunc(v)
filterfalse(pred, seq) --> elements of seq where pred(elem) is False
islice(seq, [start,] stop [, step]) --> elements from
       seq[start:stop:step]
starmap(fun, seq) --> fun(*seq[0]), fun(*seq[1]), ...
tee(it, n=2) --> (it1, it2 , ... itn) splits one iterator into n
takewhile(pred, seq) --> seq[0], seq[1], until pred fails
zip_longest(p, q, ...) --> (p[0], q[0]), (p[1], q[1]), ... 
Combinatoric generators:
product(p, q, ... [repeat=1]) --> cartesian product
permutations(p[, r])
combinations(p, r)
combinations_with_replacement(p, r)
tee(iterable, n=2) --> tuple of n independent iterators.

This module provides mechanisms to use signal handlers in Python.
Functions:
alarm() -- cause SIGALRM after a specified time [Unix only]
setitimer() -- cause a signal (described below) after a specified
               float time and the timer may restart then [Unix only]
getitimer() -- get current value of timer [Unix only]
signal() -- set the action for a given signal
getsignal() -- get the signal action for a given signal
pause() -- wait until a signal arrives [Unix only]
default_int_handler() -- default SIGINT handler
signal constants:
SIG_DFL -- used to refer to the system default handler
SIG_IGN -- used to ignore the signal
NSIG -- number of defined signals
SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc. -- signal numbers
itimer constants:
ITIMER_REAL -- decrements in real time, and delivers SIGALRM upon
               expiration
ITIMER_VIRTUAL -- decrements only when the process is executing,
               and delivers SIGVTALRM upon expiration
ITIMER_PROF -- decrements both when the process is executing and
               when the system is executing on behalf of the process.
               Coupled with ITIMER_VIRTUAL, this timer is usually
               used to profile the time spent by the application
               in user and kernel space. SIGPROF is delivered upon
               expiration.
*** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
A signal handler function is called with two arguments:
the first is the signal number, the second is the interrupted stack frame.
default_int_handler(...)
The default handler for SIGINT installed by Python.
It raises KeyboardInterrupt.
alarm($module, seconds, /)
Arrange for SIGALRM to arrive after the given number of seconds.
setitimer($module, which, seconds, interval=0.0, /)
Sets given itimer (one of ITIMER_REAL, ITIMER_VIRTUAL or ITIMER_PROF).
The timer will fire after value seconds and after that every interval seconds.
The itimer can be cleared by setting seconds to zero.
Returns old values as a tuple: (delay, interval).
getitimer($module, which, /)
Returns current value of given itimer.
signal($module, signalnum, handler, /)
Set the action for the given signal.
The action can be SIG_DFL, SIG_IGN, or a callable Python object.
The previous action is returned.  See getsignal() for possible return values.
*** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
A signal handler function is called with two arguments:
the first is the signal number, the second is the interrupted stack frame.
getsignal($module, signalnum, /)
Return the current action for the given signal.
The return value can be:
  SIG_IGN -- if the signal is being ignored
  SIG_DFL -- if the default action for the signal is in effect
  None    -- if an unknown handler is in effect
  anything else -- the callable Python object used as a handler
set_wakeup_fd(fd, *, warn_on_full_buffer=True) -> fd
Sets the fd to be written to (with the signal number) when a signal
comes in.  A library can use this to wakeup select or poll.
The previous fd or -1 is returned.
The fd must be non-blocking.
siginterrupt($module, signalnum, flag, /)
Change system call restart behaviour.
If flag is False, system calls will be restarted when interrupted by
signal sig, else system calls will be interrupted.

This module provides various functions to manipulate time values.
There are two standard representations of time.  One is the number
of seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer
or a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds).
The Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970.
The actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).
The other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.
The tuple items are:
  year (including century, e.g. 1998)
  month (1-12)
  day (1-31)
  hours (0-23)
  minutes (0-59)
  seconds (0-59)
  weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)
  Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)
  DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)
If the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;
if it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;
if it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.
time() -> floating point number
Return the current time in seconds since the Epoch.
Fractions of a second may be present if the system clock provides them.
time_ns() -> int
Return the current time in nanoseconds since the Epoch.
clock() -> floating point number
Return the CPU time or real time since the start of the process or since
the first call to clock().  This has as much precision as the system
records.
clock_gettime(clk_id) -> float
Return the time of the specified clock clk_id.
clock_gettime_ns(clk_id) -> int
Return the time of the specified clock clk_id as nanoseconds.
clock_settime(clk_id, time)
Set the time of the specified clock clk_id.
clock_settime_ns(clk_id, time)
Set the time of the specified clock clk_id with nanoseconds.
clock_getres(clk_id) -> floating point number
Return the resolution (precision) of the specified clock clk_id.
sleep(seconds)
Delay execution for a given number of seconds.  The argument may be
a floating point number for subsecond precision.
gmtime([seconds]) -> (tm_year, tm_mon, tm_mday, tm_hour, tm_min,
                       tm_sec, tm_wday, tm_yday, tm_isdst)
Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing UTC (a.k.a.
GMT).  When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.
If the platform supports the tm_gmtoff and tm_zone, they are available as
attributes only.
localtime([seconds]) -> (tm_year,tm_mon,tm_mday,tm_hour,tm_min,
                          tm_sec,tm_wday,tm_yday,tm_isdst)
Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing local time.
When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.
asctime([tuple]) -> string
Convert a time tuple to a string, e.g. 'Sat Jun 06 16:26:11 1998'.
When the time tuple is not present, current time as returned by localtime()
is used.
ctime(seconds) -> string
Convert a time in seconds since the Epoch to a string in local time.
This is equivalent to asctime(localtime(seconds)). When the time tuple is
not present, current time as returned by localtime() is used.
mktime(tuple) -> floating point number
Convert a time tuple in local time to seconds since the Epoch.
Note that mktime(gmtime(0)) will not generally return zero for most
time zones; instead the returned value will either be equal to that
of the timezone or altzone attributes on the time module.
strftime(format[, tuple]) -> string
Convert a time tuple to a string according to a format specification.
See the library reference manual for formatting codes. When the time tuple
is not present, current time as returned by localtime() is used.
Commonly used format codes:
%Y  Year with century as a decimal number.
%m  Month as a decimal number [01,12].
%d  Day of the month as a decimal number [01,31].
%H  Hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00,23].
%M  Minute as a decimal number [00,59].
%S  Second as a decimal number [00,61].
%z  Time zone offset from UTC.
%a  Locale's abbreviated weekday name.
%A  Locale's full weekday name.
%b  Locale's abbreviated month name.
%B  Locale's full month name.
%c  Locale's appropriate date and time representation.
%I  Hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12].
%p  Locale's equivalent of either AM or PM.
Other codes may be available on your platform.  See documentation for
the C library strftime function.
strptime(string, format) -> struct_time
Parse a string to a time tuple according to a format specification.
See the library reference manual for formatting codes (same as
strftime()).
Commonly used format codes:
%Y  Year with century as a decimal number.
%m  Month as a decimal number [01,12].
%d  Day of the month as a decimal number [01,31].
%H  Hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00,23].
%M  Minute as a decimal number [00,59].
%S  Second as a decimal number [00,61].
%z  Time zone offset from UTC.
%a  Locale's abbreviated weekday name.
%A  Locale's full weekday name.
%b  Locale's abbreviated month name.
%B  Locale's full month name.
%c  Locale's appropriate date and time representation.
%I  Hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12].
%p  Locale's equivalent of either AM or PM.
Other codes may be available on your platform.  See documentation for
the C library strftime function.
tzset()
Initialize, or reinitialize, the local timezone to the value stored in
os.environ['TZ']. The TZ environment variable should be specified in
standard Unix timezone format as documented in the tzset man page
(eg. 'US/Eastern', 'Europe/Amsterdam'). Unknown timezones will silently
fall back to UTC. If the TZ environment variable is not set, the local
timezone is set to the systems best guess of wallclock time.
Changing the TZ environment variable without calling tzset *may* change
the local timezone used by methods such as localtime, but this behaviour
should not be relied on.
monotonic() -> float
Monotonic clock, cannot go backward.
monotonic_ns() -> int
Monotonic clock, cannot go backward, as nanoseconds.
process_time() -> float
Process time for profiling: sum of the kernel and user-space CPU time.

sum of the kernel and user-space CPU time.
thread_time() -> float
Thread time for profiling: sum of the kernel and user-space CPU time.
thread_time() -> int
Thread time for profiling as nanoseconds:
sum of the kernel and user-space CPU time.
perf_counter() -> float
Performance counter for benchmarking.
perf_counter_ns() -> int
Performance counter for benchmarking as nanoseconds.
get_clock_info(name: str) -> dict
Get information of the specified clock.
A lock object is a synchronization primitive.  To create a lock,
call threading.Lock().  Methods are:
acquire() -- lock the lock, possibly blocking until it can be obtained
release() -- unlock of the lock
locked() -- test whether the lock is currently locked
A lock is not owned by the thread that locked it; another thread may
unlock it.  A thread attempting to lock a lock that it has already locked
will block until another thread unlocks it.  Deadlocks may ensue.
acquire(blocking=True, timeout=-1) -> bool
(acquire_lock() is an obsolete synonym)
Lock the lock.  Without argument, this blocks if the lock is already
locked (even by the same thread), waiting for another thread to release
the lock, and return True once the lock is acquired.
With an argument, this will only block if the argument is true,
and the return value reflects whether the lock is acquired.
The blocking operation is interruptible.
release()
(release_lock() is an obsolete synonym)
Release the lock, allowing another thread that is blocked waiting for
the lock to acquire the lock.  The lock must be in the locked state,
but it needn't be locked by the same thread that unlocks it.
locked() -> bool
(locked_lock() is an obsolete synonym)
Return whether the lock is in the locked state.
acquire(blocking=True) -> bool
Lock the lock.  `blocking` indicates whether we should wait
for the lock to be available or not.  If `blocking` is False
and another thread holds the lock, the method will return False
immediately.  If `blocking` is True and another thread holds
the lock, the method will wait for the lock to be released,
take it and then return True.
(note: the blocking operation is interruptible.)
In all other cases, the method will return True immediately.
Precisely, if the current thread already holds the lock, its
internal counter is simply incremented. If nobody holds the lock,
the lock is taken and its internal counter initialized to 1.
release()
Release the lock, allowing another thread that is blocked waiting for
the lock to acquire the lock.  The lock must be in the locked state,
and must be locked by the same thread that unlocks it; otherwise a
`RuntimeError` is raised.
Do note that if the lock was acquire()d several times in a row by the
current thread, release() needs to be called as many times for the lock
to be available for other threads.
_is_owned() -> bool
For internal use by `threading.Condition`.
_acquire_restore(state) -> None
For internal use by `threading.Condition`.
_release_save() -> tuple
For internal use by `threading.Condition`.
This module provides primitive operations to write multi-threaded programs.
The 'threading' module provides a more convenient interface.
start_new_thread(function, args[, kwargs])
(start_new() is an obsolete synonym)
Start a new thread and return its identifier.  The thread will call the
function with positional arguments from the tuple args and keyword arguments
taken from the optional dictionary kwargs.  The thread exits when the
function returns; the return value is ignored.  The thread will also exit
when the function raises an unhandled exception; a stack trace will be
printed unless the exception is SystemExit.
allocate_lock() -> lock object
(allocate() is an obsolete synonym)
Create a new lock object. See help(type(threading.Lock())) for
information about locks.
exit()
(exit_thread() is an obsolete synonym)
This is synonymous to ``raise SystemExit''.  It will cause the current
thread to exit silently unless the exception is caught.
interrupt_main()
Raise a KeyboardInterrupt in the main thread.
A subthread can use this function to interrupt the main thread.
get_ident() -> integer
Return a non-zero integer that uniquely identifies the current thread
amongst other threads that exist simultaneously.
This may be used to identify per-thread resources.
Even though on some platforms threads identities may appear to be
allocated consecutive numbers starting at 1, this behavior should not
be relied upon, and the number should be seen purely as a magic cookie.
A thread's identity may be reused for another thread after it exits.
_count() -> integer
Return the number of currently running Python threads, excluding 
the main thread. The returned number comprises all threads created
through `start_new_thread()` as well as `threading.Thread`, and not
yet finished.
This function is meant for internal and specialized purposes only.
In most applications `threading.enumerate()` should be used instead.
stack_size([size]) -> size
Return the thread stack size used when creating new threads.  The
optional size argument specifies the stack size (in bytes) to be used
for subsequently created threads, and must be 0 (use platform or
configured default) or a positive integer value of at least 32,768 (32k).
If changing the thread stack size is unsupported, a ThreadError
exception is raised.  If the specified size is invalid, a ValueError
exception is raised, and the stack size is unmodified.  32k bytes
 currently the minimum supported stack size value to guarantee
sufficient stack space for the interpreter itself.
Note that some platforms may have particular restrictions on values for
the stack size, such as requiring a minimum stack size larger than 32 KiB or
requiring allocation in multiples of the system memory page size
- platform documentation should be referred to for more information
(4 KiB pages are common; using multiples of 4096 for the stack size is
the suggested approach in the absence of more specific information).
_set_sentinel() -> lock
Set a sentinel lock that will be released when the current thread
state is finalized (after it is untied from the interpreter).
This is a private API for the threading module.
Support for POSIX locales.
(integer,string=None) -> string. Activates/queries locale processing.
() -> dict. Returns numeric and monetary locale-specific parameters.
string,string -> int. Compares two strings according to the locale.
strxfrm(string) -> string.
Return a string that can be used as a key for locale-aware comparisons.
nl_langinfo(key) -> string
Return the value for the locale information associated with key.
The io module provides the Python interfaces to stream handling. The
builtin open function is defined in this module.
At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It
defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are
allowed to raise an OSError if they do not support a given operation.
Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and
writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide
an interface to OS files.
BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its
subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer
streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.
BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access
streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.
Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding
of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text
interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO
is an in-memory stream for text.
Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments
of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.
data:
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE
   An int containing the default buffer size used by the module's buffered
   I/O classes. open() uses the file's blksize (as obtained by os.stat) if
   possible.
open($module, /, file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None,
     errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)
Open file and return a stream.  Raise OSError upon failure.
file is either a text or byte string giving the name (and the path
if the file isn't in the current working directory) of the file to
be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be
wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the
returned I/O object is closed, unless closefd is set to False.)
mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file
is opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text
mode.  Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if
it already exists), 'x' for creating and writing to a new file, and
'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes
append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position).
In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform
dependent: locale.getpreferredencoding(False) is called to get the
current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary
mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available modes are:
========= ===============================================================
Character Meaning
--------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
'r'       open for reading (default)
'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
'x'       create a new file and open it for writing
'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
'b'       binary mode
't'       text mode (default)
'+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
'U'       universal newline mode (deprecated)
========= ===============================================================
The default mode is 'rt' (open for reading text). For binary random
access, the mode 'w+b' opens and truncates the file to 0 bytes, while
'r+b' opens the file without truncation. The 'x' mode implies 'w' and
raises an `FileExistsError` if the file already exists.
Python distinguishes between files opened in binary and text modes,
even when the underlying operating system doesn't. Files opened in
binary mode (appending 'b' to the mode argument) return contents as
bytes objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when
't' is appended to the mode argument), the contents of the file are
returned as strings, the bytes having been first decoded using a
platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given.
'U' mode is deprecated and will raise an exception in future versions
of Python.  It has no effect in Python 3.  Use newline to control
universal newlines mode.
buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy.
Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select
line buffering (only usable in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate
the size of a fixed-size chunk buffer.  When no buffering argument is
given, the default buffering policy works as follows:
* Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer
  is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device's
  "block size" and falling back on `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.
  On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.
* "Interactive" text files (files for which isatty() returns True)
  use line buffering.  Other text files use the policy described above
  for binary files.
encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the
file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is
platform dependent, but any encoding supported by Python can be
passed.  See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings.
errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding errors are to
be handled---this argument should not be used in binary mode. Pass
'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error
(the default of None has the same effect), or pass 'ignore' to ignore
errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.)
See the documentation for codecs.register or run 'help(codecs.Codec)'
for a list of the permitted encoding error strings.
newline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text
mode). It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as
follows:
* On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is
  enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and
  these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
  caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
  endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
  the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
  string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.
* On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
  translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
  newline is '' or '\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any
  of the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated
  to the given string.
If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open
when the file is closed. This does not work when a file name is given
and must be True in that case.
A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as *opener*. The
underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by
calling *opener* with (*file*, *flags*). *opener* must return an open
file descriptor (passing os.open as *opener* results in functionality
similar to passing None).
open() returns a file object whose type depends on the mode, and
through which the standard file operations such as reading and writing
are performed. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ('w',
'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), it returns a TextIOWrapper. When used to open
a file in a binary mode, the returned class varies: in read binary
mode, it returns a BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary
modes, it returns a BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns
a BufferedRandom.
It is also possible to use a string or bytearray as a file for both
reading and writing. For strings StringIO can be used like a file
opened in a text mode, and for bytes a BytesIO can be used like a file
opened in a binary mode.
The abstract base class for all I/O classes, acting on streams of
bytes. There is no public constructor.
This class provides dummy implementations for many methods that
derived classes can override selectively; the default implementations
represent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.
Even though IOBase does not declare read, readinto, or write because
their signatures will vary, implementations and clients should
consider those methods part of the interface. Also, implementations
may raise UnsupportedOperation when operations they do not support are
called.
The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is
bytes. Other bytes-like objects are accepted as method arguments too.
In some cases (such as readinto), a writable object is required. Text
I/O classes work with str data.
Note that calling any method (except additional calls to close(),
which are ignored) on a closed stream should raise a ValueError.
IOBase (and its subclasses) support the iterator protocol, meaning
that an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a
stream.
IOBase also supports the :keyword:`with` statement. In this example,
fp is closed after the suite of the with statement is complete:
with open('spam.txt', 'r') as fp:
    fp.write('Spam and eggs!')
Base class for raw binary I/O.
Change stream position.
Change the stream position to the given byte offset. The offset is
interpreted relative to the position indicated by whence.  Values
for whence are:
* 0 -- start of stream (the default); offset should be zero or positive
* 1 -- current stream position; offset may be negative
* 2 -- end of stream; offset is usually negative
Return the new absolute position.
tell($self, /)
Return current stream position.
Truncate file to size bytes.
File pointer is left unchanged.  Size defaults to the current IO
position as reported by tell().  Returns the new size.
flush($self, /)
Flush write buffers, if applicable.
This is not implemented for read-only and non-blocking streams.
close($self, /)
Flush and close the IO object.
This method has no effect if the file is already closed.
seekable($self, /)
Return whether object supports random access.
If False, seek(), tell() and truncate() will raise OSError.
This method may need to do a test seek().
readable($self, /)
Return whether object was opened for reading.
If False, read() will raise OSError.
writable($self, /)
Return whether object was opened for writing.
If False, write() will raise OSError.
fileno($self, /)
Returns underlying file descriptor if one exists.
OSError is raised if the IO object does not use a file descriptor.
isatty($self, /)
Return whether this is an 'interactive' stream.
Return False if it can't be determined.
readline($self, size=-1, /)
Read and return a line from the stream.
If size is specified, at most size bytes will be read.
The line terminator is always b'\n' for binary files; for text
files, the newlines argument to open can be used to select the line
terminator(s) recognized.
readlines($self, hint=-1, /)
Return a list of lines from the stream.
hint can be specified to control the number of lines read: no more
lines will be read if the total size (in bytes/characters) of all
lines so far exceeds hint.
writelines($self, lines, /)
read($self, size=-1, /)
readall($self, /)
Read until EOF, using multiple read() call.
FileIO(file, mode='r', closefd=True, opener=None)
Open a file.
The mode can be 'r' (default), 'w', 'x' or 'a' for reading,
writing, exclusive creation or appending.  The file will be created if it
doesn't exist when opened for writing or appending; it will be truncated
when opened for writing.  A FileExistsError will be raised if it already
exists when opened for creating. Opening a file for creating implies
writing so this mode behaves in a similar way to 'w'.Add a '+' to the mode
to allow simultaneous reading and writing. A custom opener can be used by
passing a callable as *opener*. The underlying file descriptor for the file
object is then obtained by calling opener with (*name*, *flags*).
*opener* must return an open file descriptor (passing os.open as *opener*
results in functionality similar to passing None).
read($self, size=-1, /)
Read at most size bytes, returned as bytes.
Only makes one system call, so less data may be returned than requested.
In non-blocking mode, returns None if no data is available.
Return an empty bytes object at EOF.
readall($self, /)
Read all data from the file, returned as bytes.
In non-blocking mode, returns as much as is immediately available,
or None if no data is available.  Return an empty bytes object at EOF.
readinto($self, buffer, /)
Same as RawIOBase.readinto().
write($self, b, /)
Write buffer b to file, return number of bytes written.
Only makes one system call, so not all of the data may be written.
The number of bytes actually written is returned.  In non-blocking mode,
returns None if the write would block.
seek($self, pos, whence=0, /)
Move to new file position and return the file position.
Argument offset is a byte count.  Optional argument whence defaults to
SEEK_SET or 0 (offset from start of file, offset should be >= 0); other values
are SEEK_CUR or 1 (move relative to current position, positive or negative),
and SEEK_END or 2 (move relative to end of file, usually negative, although
many platforms allow seeking beyond the end of a file).
Note that not all file objects are seekable.
tell($self, /)
Current file position.
Can raise OSError for non seekable files.
truncate($self, size=None, /)
Truncate the file to at most size bytes and return the truncated size.
Size defaults to the current file position, as returned by tell().
The current file position is changed to the value of size.
close($self, /)
Close the file.
A closed file cannot be used for further I/O operations.  close() may be
called more than once without error.
seekable($self, /)
True if file supports random-access.
readable($self, /)
True if file was opened in a read mode.
writable($self, /)
True if file was opened in a write mode.
fileno($self, /)
Return the underlying file descriptor (an integer).
isatty($self, /)
True if the file is connected to a TTY device.
BytesIO(initial_bytes=b'')
Buffered I/O implementation using an in-memory bytes buffer.
readable($self, /)
Returns True if the IO object can be read.
seekable($self, /)
Returns True if the IO object can be seeked.
writable($self, /)
Returns True if the IO object can be written.
close($self, /)
Disable all I/O operations.
flush($self, /)
Does nothing.
isatty($self, /)
Always returns False.
BytesIO objects are not connected to a TTY-like device.
tell($self, /)
Current file position, an integer.
write($self, b, /)
Write bytes to file.
Return the number of bytes written.
writelines($self, lines, /)
Write lines to the file.
Note that newlines are not added.  lines can be any iterable object
producing bytes-like objects. This is equivalent to calling write() for
each element.
read1($self, size=-1, /)
Read at most size bytes, returned as a bytes object.
If the size argument is negative or omitted, read until EOF is reached.
Return an empty bytes object at EOF.
readinto($self, buffer, /)
Read bytes into buffer.
Returns number of bytes read (0 for EOF), or None if the object
is set not to block and has no data to read.
readline($self, size=-1, /)
Next line from the file, as a bytes object.
Retain newline.  A non-negative size argument limits the maximum
number of bytes to return (an incomplete line may be returned then).
Return an empty bytes object at EOF.
readlines($self, size=None, /)
List of bytes objects, each a line from the file.
Call readline() repeatedly and return a list of the lines so read.
The optional size argument, if given, is an approximate bound on the
total number of bytes in the lines returned.
read($self, size=-1, /)
Read at most size bytes, returned as a bytes object.
If the size argument is negative, read until EOF is reached.
Return an empty bytes object at EOF.
getbuffer($self, /)
Get a read-write view over the contents of the BytesIO object.
getvalue($self, /)
Retrieve the entire contents of the BytesIO object.
seek($self, pos, whence=0, /)
Change stream position.
Seek to byte offset pos relative to position indicated by whence:
     0  Start of stream (the default).  pos should be >= 0;
     1  Current position - pos may be negative;
     2  End of stream - pos usually negative.
Returns the new absolute position.
truncate($self, size=None, /)
Truncate the file to at most size bytes.
Size defaults to the current file position, as returned by tell().
The current file position is unchanged.  Returns the new size.
Base class for buffered IO objects.
The main difference with RawIOBase is that the read() method
supports omitting the size argument, and does not have a default
implementation that defers to readinto().
In addition, read(), readinto() and write() may raise
BlockingIOError if the underlying raw stream is in non-blocking
mode and not ready; unlike their raw counterparts, they will never
return None.
A typical implementation should not inherit from a RawIOBase
implementation, but wrap one.
BufferedReader(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)
Create a new buffered reader using the given readable raw IO object.
BufferedWriter(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)
A buffer for a writeable sequential RawIO object.
The constructor creates a BufferedWriter for the given writeable raw
stream. If the buffer_size is not given, it defaults to
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE.
BufferedRWPair(reader, writer, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE, /)
A buffered reader and writer object together.
A buffered reader object and buffered writer object put together to
form a sequential IO object that can read and write. This is typically
used with a socket or two-way pipe.
reader and writer are RawIOBase objects that are readable and
writeable respectively. If the buffer_size is omitted it defaults to
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE.
BufferedRandom(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)
A buffered interface to random access streams.
The constructor creates a reader and writer for a seekable stream,
raw, given in the first argument. If the buffer_size is omitted it
defaults to DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE.
detach($self, /)
Disconnect this buffer from its underlying raw stream and return it.
After the raw stream has been detached, the buffer is in an unusable
state.
Read and return up to n bytes.
If the argument is omitted, None, or negative, reads and
returns all data until EOF.
If the argument is positive, and the underlying raw stream is
not 'interactive', multiple raw reads may be issued to satisfy
the byte count (unless EOF is reached first).  But for
interactive raw streams (as well as sockets and pipes), at most
one raw read will be issued, and a short result does not imply
that EOF is imminent.
Returns an empty bytes object on EOF.
Returns None if the underlying raw stream was open in non-blocking
mode and no data is available at the moment.
Read and return up to n bytes, with at most one read() call
to the underlying raw stream. A short result does not imply
that EOF is imminent.
Returns an empty bytes object on EOF.
readinto($self, buffer, /)
readinto1($self, buffer, /)
Write the given buffer to the IO stream.
Returns the number of bytes written, which is always the length of b
in bytes.
Raises BlockingIOError if the buffer is full and the
underlying raw stream cannot accept more data at the moment.
read($self, size=-1, /)
peek($self, size=0, /)
read1($self, size=-1, /)
readinto($self, buffer, /)
readinto1($self, buffer, /)
readline($self, size=-1, /)
seek($self, target, whence=0, /)
truncate($self, pos=None, /)
write($self, buffer, /)
Base class for text I/O.
This class provides a character and line based interface to stream
I/O. There is no readinto method because Python's character strings
are immutable. There is no public constructor.
IncrementalNewlineDecoder(decoder, translate, errors='strict')
Codec used when reading a file in universal newlines mode.
It wraps another incremental decoder, translating \r\n and \r into \n.
It also records the types of newlines encountered.  When used with
translate=False, it ensures that the newline sequence is returned in
one piece. When used with decoder=None, it expects unicode strings as
decode input and translates newlines without first invoking an external
decoder.
TextIOWrapper(buffer, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None,
              line_buffering=False, write_through=False)
Character and line based layer over a BufferedIOBase object, buffer.
encoding gives the name of the encoding that the stream will be
decoded or encoded with. It defaults to locale.getpreferredencoding(False).
errors determines the strictness of encoding and decoding (see
help(codecs.Codec) or the documentation for codecs.register) and
defaults to "strict".
newline controls how line endings are handled. It can be None, '',
'\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as follows:
* On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is
  enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and
  these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
  caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
  endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
  the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
  string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.
* On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
  translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
  newline is '' or '\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any
  of the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated
  to the given string.
If line_buffering is True, a call to flush is implied when a call to
write contains a newline character.
Separate the underlying buffer from the TextIOBase and return it.
After the underlying buffer has been detached, the TextIO is in an
unusable state.
Read at most n characters from stream.
Read from underlying buffer until we have n characters or we hit EOF.
If n is negative or omitted, read until EOF.
Read until newline or EOF.
Returns an empty string if EOF is hit immediately.
Write string to stream.
Returns the number of characters written (which is always equal to
the length of the string).
Encoding of the text stream.
Subclasses should override.
Line endings translated so far.
Only line endings translated during reading are considered.
Subclasses should override.
The error setting of the decoder or encoder.
Subclasses should override.

StringIO(initial_value='', newline='\n')
Text I/O implementation using an in-memory buffer.
The initial_value argument sets the value of object.  The newline
argument is like the one of TextIOWrapper's constructor.
close($self, /)
Close the IO object.
Attempting any further operation after the object is closed
will raise a ValueError.
This method has no effect if the file is already closed.
getvalue($self, /)
Retrieve the entire contents of the object.
read($self, size=-1, /)
Read at most size characters, returned as a string.
If the argument is negative or omitted, read until EOF
is reached. Return an empty string at EOF.
readline($self, size=-1, /)
Read until newline or EOF.
Returns an empty string if EOF is hit immediately.
tell($self, /)
Tell the current file position.
truncate($self, pos=None, /)
Truncate size to pos.
The pos argument defaults to the current file position, as
returned by tell().  The current file position is unchanged.
Returns the new absolute position.
seek($self, pos, whence=0, /)
Change stream position.
Seek to character offset pos relative to position indicated by whence:
    0  Start of stream (the default).  pos should be >= 0;
    1  Current position - pos must be 0;
    2  End of stream - pos must be 0.
Returns the new absolute position.
write($self, s, /)
Write string to file.
Returns the number of characters written, which is always equal to
the length of the string.
seekable($self, /)
Returns True if the IO object can be seeked.
readable($self, /)
Returns True if the IO object can be read.
writable($self, /)
Returns True if the IO object can be written.

    A path-like object to a zipfile, or to a specific path inside
    a zipfile.
'archivepath' must be a path-like object to a zipfile, or to a specific path
inside a zipfile. For example, it can be '/tmp/myimport.zip', or
'/tmp/myimport.zip/mydirectory', if mydirectory is a valid directory inside
the archive.
'ZipImportError' is raised if 'archivepath' doesn't point to a valid Zip
archive.
The 'archive' attribute of the zipimporter object contains the name of the
zipfile targeted.
find_module($self, fullname, path=None, /)
Search for a module specified by 'fullname'.
'fullname' must be the fully qualified (dotted) module name. It returns the
zipimporter instance itself if the module was found, or None if it wasn't.
The optional 'path' argument is ignored -- it's there for compatibility
with the importer protocol.
find_loader($self, fullname, path=None, /)
Search for a module specified by 'fullname'.
'fullname' must be the fully qualified (dotted) module name. It returns the
zipimporter instance itself if the module was found, a string containing the
full path name if it's possibly a portion of a namespace package,
or None otherwise. The optional 'path' argument is ignored -- it's
there for compatibility with the importer protocol.
load_module($self, fullname, /)
Load the module specified by 'fullname'.
'fullname' must be the fully qualified (dotted) module name. It returns the
imported module, or raises ZipImportError if it wasn't found.
get_filename($self, fullname, /)
Return the filename for the specified module.
is_package($self, fullname, /)
Return True if the module specified by fullname is a package.
Raise ZipImportError if the module couldn't be found.
get_data($self, pathname, /)
Return the data associated with 'pathname'.
Raise OSError if the file was not found.
get_code($self, fullname, /)
Return the code object for the specified module.
Raise ZipImportError if the module couldn't be found.
get_source($self, fullname, /)
Return the source code for the specified module.
Raise ZipImportError if the module couldn't be found, return None if the
archive does contain the module, but has no source for it.
get_resource_reader($self, fullname, /)
Return the ResourceReader for a package in a zip file.
If 'fullname' is a package within the zip file, return the 'ResourceReader'
object for the package.  Otherwise return None.
zipimport provides support for importing Python modules from Zip archives.
This module exports three objects:
- zipimporter: a class; its constructor takes a path to a Zip archive.
- ZipImportError: exception raised by zipimporter objects. It's a
  subclass of ImportError, so it can be caught as ImportError, too.
- _zip_directory_cache: a dict, mapping archive paths to zip directory
  info dicts, as used in zipimporter._files.
It is usually not needed to use the zipimport module explicitly; it is
used by the builtin import mechanism for sys.path items that are paths
to Zip archives.
faulthandler module.
Debug module to trace memory blocks allocated by Python.
is_tracing($module, /)
Return True if the tracemalloc module is tracing Python memory allocations.
clear_traces($module, /)
Clear traces of memory blocks allocated by Python.
_get_traces($module, /)
Get traces of all memory blocks allocated by Python.
Return a list of (size: int, traceback: tuple) tuples.
traceback is a tuple of (filename: str, lineno: int) tuples.
Return an empty list if the tracemalloc module is disabled.
_get_object_traceback($module, obj, /)
Get the traceback where the Python object obj was allocated.
Return a tuple of (filename: str, lineno: int) tuples.
Return None if the tracemalloc module is disabled or did not
trace the allocation of the object.
start($module, nframe=1, /)
Start tracing Python memory allocations.
Also set the maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of a
trace to nframe.
stop($module, /)
Stop tracing Python memory allocations.
Also clear traces of memory blocks allocated by Python.
get_traceback_limit($module, /)
Get the maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of a trace.
By default, a trace of an allocated memory block only stores
the most recent frame: the limit is 1.
get_tracemalloc_memory($module, /)
Get the memory usage in bytes of the tracemalloc module.
This memory is used internally to trace memory allocations.
get_traced_memory($module, /)
Get the current size and peak size of memory blocks traced by tracemalloc.
Returns a tuple: (current: int, peak: int).
symtable($module, str, filename, startstr, /)
Return symbol and scope dictionaries used internally by compiler.
xxsubtype is an example module showing how to subtype builtin types from C.
test_descr.py in the standard test suite requires it in order to complete.
If you don't care about the examples, and don't intend to run the Python
test suite, you can recompile Python without Modules/xxsubtype.c.
